  I completely agree with your point of view. The first brand new phone I got
  was a iPhone 5 32GB when it first came out. I love iOS 6 so much and wish
  newer versions of iOS had a classic UI mode just like windows does. Ever since
  I started using iOS 7 on my iPhone 5 and was later forced to iOS 8 when I
  bought my iPhone 6 jailbreaking has become a neccesity for me. I will only
  keep using an iPhone as my daily driver as ling as new jailbreaks keep getting
  released. Unfortunately, my iPhone 6 which is now happily jailbroken on iOS
  9.3.3 does not recognize sim cards. I am guessing something is wrong with the
  baseband processor so I was forced to upgrade once again. I am curently using
  an iPhone X on ios 11.1.2 and I can not stand all of the changes. No 32 bit
  app support, network scanners no longer show mac addresses, the new music app
  and app store redesign make me want to puke, etc, etc.
