  Dear Keaton, I appreciate and share your love for the Yahoo! Konfabulator
  widget engine, and the many widgets that were once available in the Yahoo!
  gadget gallery.  I still have my (active/working) engine auto-docked on the
  right-hand side of my screen.  (And,yes, it still makes that sound when
  expanding and closing.)  And, my Yahoo! weather widget is still working!  I
  have an offer to make to you about fixing the your Yahoo! weather widget, if
  you are still interested in getting it working again.  My offer is this:  I
  can provide you with the download which will fix the widget in exchange for
  some help in getting another Yahoo!  widget to function again.  The Yahoo!
  widget I would like to see functioning again is the Earthquake widget which
  was once found in the Yahoo! gadget gallery.  I know where the source code is
  available for viewing and where to download the .exe file.  Please let me know
  if you're interested.  Thanks.
