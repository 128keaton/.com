                    <p>Originally introduced in 1995, the Power Macintosh 8500 was a working class man’s machine. For $4,000, you could buy mini-tower machine with a 120MHz CPU with a FPU. It also had some really nice A/V features, so you could import little Timmy’s birthday from your S-Video camera. All-in-all, not a bad machine. The average going rate for these on eBay are about $39. I picked up two in poor condition for $20, good price. I built up one out of parts of both, but I didn’t really get around to playing with it, until now.</p>

<p>First things first, I opened it up again. No hard drives or caddies. Shame, since is an older SCSI format. No IDE on this old boy. I went to eBay, in search of a decent, and cheap card, and I couldn’t really find a suitable one, until A friend directed me to a generic card, that was advertised as working. I ordered it from China and waited. And waited. However, a week before I got the card, I found something really cool at work.</p>

<p>An Adaptec HotConnect 8945, not only for PCs, but it was Macintosh compatible as well.</p>

<p>Sweet!</p>

<p>Lets open that box!</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1669.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Look at all of those goodies.</p>

<p>We have (from bottom to top, left to right):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Registration/readme card.</li>
  <li>User Manual (with a ton of tips and other good information)</li>
  <li>A (new?)SCSI to (older?) SCSI adaptor.</li>
  <li>A FireWire to DV cable.</li>
  <li>The bundled software CD.</li>
  <li>A Windows NT/95 install floppy.</li>
  <li>Molex to bus power.</li>
  <li>Long, gray FireWire cable.</li>
  <li>External SCSI cable.</li>
  <li>Portable SCSI-&gt;Large SCSI Adaptor.</li>
  <li>The card itself (one internal SCSI, one external, 1 internal FireWire, 2 external FireWire).</li>
  <li>One, very long, SCSI cable with a terminator on the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>A very sweet package!</p>

<p>Here is a close shot of the card:</p>

<p>Doesn’t really look used at all.</p>

<p>Anyway, onto the upgrading.</p>

<p>First, after trial-and-error, both of my Apple SCSI CD-ROM drives didn’t want to read anything. Wouldn’t spin up worth a darn. From a recommendation, I tried using an IDE CD ROM, with my fancy ATA card, and it worked. I did not believe it. Next, since I was all out of IDE cables long enough, I decided to use the SCSI card too. Hey, its cool, right? I paired it up with a 10,000 RPM (!!!) Jaguar drive that came in a QuickSilver, long broken. I was able to reassemble the case, just fine, and booted the installer. After about five minutes, OS 9.1 was rocking on the 8500.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1679.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Final specs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ATA100 card, with CD-RW drive.</li>
  <li>SCSI card, with 10,000 RPM drive.</li>
  <li>46MB of RAM.</li>
  <li>150MHz CPU, not the lowly 120MHz.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not too shabby.</p>

<p>Maybe sometime soon, I’ll put Tiger on it, along side some more RAM.</p>

<p>Oh, I was also able to solve the Kanga Conundrum. The ATA card I purchased featured an Onboard PATA connector, so I booted into 9.1 and blessed the new drive. Problem solved.</p>
