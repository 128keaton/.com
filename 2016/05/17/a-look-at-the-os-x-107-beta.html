The date on the install CD is 2011, and for those who do not know, Lion was officially released July of 2011.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sli.mg/SpKARz.jpg" alt="Lion 2011 Beta" /></p>

<p>Quickly, I pulled out my trusty 2009 Black MacBook to do a test install. I did, however, try anyway on my MacBookPro1,1, just in case we had a 32-bit EFI bootloader. On initial glance at the DVD, which init of itself is quite amazing, since Lion was never sold on one. Only digital download or on a $20 USB stick (which I own too), there wasn’t any welcome documentation, nor was there the Lion install icon, but something more generic instead.</p>

<p>Just X</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Anyway, onto installing. I booted into the installer, and was greeted by the modern ‘OS X Utilities’, but had stylings stuck between Snow Leopard and Lion.</p>

<p>Another weird thing inside of Disk Utility:</p>

<p>The segment control was nothing like I’ve seen before.</p>

<p>Anyway, post installation time, time for setup. We did get the lovely welcome video from Leopard, which was refreshing, even after hearing it a billion times.</p>

<p>First, the background wasn’t the sterile gray, we had a nice picture of Mt. Fiji:</p>

<p>I personally think it looks far better, I never noticed how nice that pic looks.</p>

<p>Then, it gave me the option to add encrypt my disk, something not implemented until 10.10. I wonder why they didn’t do it when they had the option to.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sli.mg/kUYguu.jpg" alt="Yosemite? Anyone?" /></p>

<p>I opted not to, just in case some odd bug arose, which prevented me from exploring the rest of the operating system.</p>

<p>Here we are at the desktop of 10.7, beta! Take note of the Launchpad icon.
Quite ugly, glad it was changed.</p>

<p>I went to About My Mac-&gt;More Info, just to see the build number, and was greeted by this:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sli.mg/qrAxI9.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some weird mutant view. I do kinda like it though, not the icons.</p>

<p>The battery view is very nice, I could definitely see this making a come back, maybe with an overall battery health meter, a la CoconutBattery?</p>

<p>Oh, I should probably update that :)</p>

<p>That about wraps it up.</p>
