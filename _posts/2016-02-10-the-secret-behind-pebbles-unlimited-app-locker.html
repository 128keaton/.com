<p>After using my Pebble Time for a while, I noticed something strange. I don&rsquo;t have the 8 watchface&#47;app limit like my old Pebble. Strange. After some prodding with iFile I learnt that they are stored on the iPhone. Makes sense, considering that we can use color assets, which equal large filesizes. That also explains the amount of loading time between launching apps and changing watchfaces. Fun times.</p>
