Ok, full confession, I did this about a year ago. A client called me up and told me their iMac wasn't booting. I went over, took a look and noticed the symptoms of a bad graphics card. Uh oh. I told them the diagnosis and explained that there was a possibility that it could be fixed, but it would be risky and costly (my services).

Fortunately, they are the type of people who buy a new car when the time comes to change the oil, so they set the iMac aside and got a new 27 inch iMac 'knife'. I came back later to do a check up on their current iMac, and noticed the old one in the corner. I asked if they were going to sell it, but they actually said I could have it. 
	
I brought it home and began disassembling. I followed an excellent iFixit guide and got the graphics card out of the machine. Next I did some research, and learned that reflowing a card is a good way to get it working. The 'sweet spot' for my card was 400F for about ten minutes. I then let it rest for another ten, and then back in at 400F for another ten. I reassembled the machine, taking care to put everything back. I fired it up and lo and behold, it worked.
