Welcome back to another segment of 'Cheap-Oh no!'. Today, we are looking at a power supply that came with a USB->PATA/IDE/SATA bridge. I burnt out my last one, and I didn't pay close enough attention to what I'd, unfortunately, purchased. Whoopsie. Honey, I bought a knock-off.

Look at that. 'Trained Service Personal Only', I am personally trained in service, yes.

Nothing grabs your attention like HAZARDOUSAREA and ZONEDANGEREUSE.

Oh. Darn. No Servilceable components inside, too bad I am servicing instead.

Lets unscrew the case.

Except, there aren't any. Yup, this new, user-friendly design allows you to just *pull* the case apart, exposing the electrifying innards. Neat!

Now, lets look at the soldering. Looks like it was thrown together like a monkey on crack, which would explain the working conditions of the rest of the factory. The board, however, looks nicely laid out, from below.

Notice what is missing? Freaking *fuses*. Have fun with this one, kiddos, it is sure to be a *wild* ride.

You know what should've tipped me off? The fact that the brand on Amazon was 'Generic'

Don't buy [this](http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Adapter-Converter-Optical-External/dp/B002OV1VJW?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00).
