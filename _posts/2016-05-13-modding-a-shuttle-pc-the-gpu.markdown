Today I received a ShuttleX PC. It is a small form-factor machine, with a custom board. Smaller than an ITX board, the custom motherboard inside of the ShuttleX features a PCI and AGP slot, 2xDDR2 RAM slots, and a Pentium 4 CPU. Although, not too powerful, it is still a very cool machine. However, it has been a long-time dream of mine to have a PC that is easily carried around. This one fits in my backpack.

Anyway, onto the modification. A penalty of doing an ITX mod is that you lose a PCI-E slot. Not on your board, but on the outside of the case. The custom motherboard is designed in such a way, that there are two slots, but it is one slot too close. Instead of brutally hacking at the case until something happens, I decided to make the GPU of choice a 'low profile' card.

Speaking of the GPU choice, I have a spare GTX650 I am going to use.


It is an EVGA 'SuperClocked' card, and it is pretty snappy for most games. CS-GO doesn't need much, you guys.

## Disassembly:

First, taking the card apart:

There are four screws 'under' the fan blades, and one 'holding' the PCIE cover on. Remove those and the case.

Now, finding a card that has a similar port layout.

I found something that worked, well with enough work. I do not know what/where it came from, but it was one of those OEM Dell cards with the multi-monitor port.


I removed the bracket from the GTX 650 as well, so I could trace the ports and cut to spec, not hard in theory.

## Modding:

Here is the card in its 'pre surgical' state. The black marks are simply permanent marker marks.

And its 'post surgical state'. She isn't pretty yet. I just used a drill bit to remove the majority of the metal, and I'll file/cut finer with a Dremel.

For some reason, I didn't get a between photo, but I just used a Dremel cutting wheel and polishing wedge to get the job done. The port was shaped decently so.

Here is a photo of me comparing with the OEM card inside of the ShuttleX. The port layout works fine!

## Final Product:

I do not know temperatures yet, or if I'll need a fan. Time will tell.
