Hello, world! This is my new blog. I've finally moved over from WordPress, after the bajillionth or so 'security scare'. Some links **have** moved around a bit, so make sure you know where you are going.

For instance, I've migrated my collection page from [http://128keaton.com/hardware](http://128keaton.com/hardware) to [http://128keaton.com/machines](http://128keaton.com/machines), it just makes more sense. I need to make an extra page for some of my other machines, but thats a task for later. What is important, is that the *core* information is here. I redesigned the landing page, because my site isn't just applications, (although that was a big part initially) there was so much more to be seen that wasn't easily accessed.

As for WordPress, I'm sad that I am leaving on bad terms. It was my blogging software choice for five years, but I've had it up to here. Now, this site is written in HTML5, and compiled in Jekyll. I'm using a number of Atom packages for Markdown *and* Jekyll, which makes it easier. There are a couple of pages that aren't using the new site format, the app pages for instance, but those will be rewritten when time permits, as they work just fine. 'Lil rebels. Anyway, if you have any issues working with the new site, have lost something important (i.e. your dog), feel free to contact me. - Keaton
