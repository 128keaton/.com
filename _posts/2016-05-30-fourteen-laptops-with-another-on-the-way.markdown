Yup, that is fourteen laptops right there.

Here they are, left to right, top to bottom.

- PowerBook G3 Kanga
- PowerBook G3 Pismo
- iBook G3 Clamshell, Tangerine
- iBook G3 Clamshell, Indigo
- PowerBook Ti, 867 (hinge said adios)
- iBook G4 800MHz
- PowerBook G4 17" 1.67GHz
- iBook G4 1.42GHz (!!!)
- PowerBook G4 12" 1.5GHz
- MacBook Pro 1,1, 15" 2.0GHz
- MacBook Pro 3,1, 17" 2.4GHz
- MacBook Pro 4,1 15" 2.5GHz (BTO)
- MacBook mid-2007
- MacBook early-2009

As for the 'one on the way', I won a $15 PowerBook 12" to replace my forlorn 12" that is EXTREMELY battered. It will be an excellent parts machine for this lovely 12" (which will need the top case replaced).

Recently, I got another MacBook Pro, a 17" which needed the logic board baked and a 1.42GHz iBook G4. I really enjoy the speed of the iBook, but the 1.5GHz PowerBook will smoke it. I am a bit curious of the performance between the two GPUs, and another odd thing, the 12" has 1.25GB max, while the iBook maxes at 1.5GB. Time will tell.
