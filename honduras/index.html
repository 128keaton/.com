<p>This year, I am pleased to announce that I will be traveling with Fellowship Memphis to Tegucigalpa, Honduras to serve with Point of Impact ministries. In the past, my sister has gone, and if you helped her last year, then I thank you for your support. Her time and effort there has inspired my effort to go and join her for one week this summer, June 9th through the 16th. I am so excited to serve alongside the people who really do make a difference in sharing the Gospel to the many without light in their lives. From previous years I know that there will be plenty of work to be done, such as helping with vacation Bible schools, or delivering life essentials to those without.</p>

<p>This trip will be my first out of the country, and into a country so very different from our own. As a result, I am ecstatic to learn about their cultures and their people.</p>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>That is where you come in. My projected costs for this trip are over $1500, and I know with support from others, I can reach that goal. If you are willing to donate, there are a couple ways you can do so. You can go to fellowshipmemphis.org/outreach/honduras/ and select an amount, or send a check to:</p>
<div class="check">
Fellowship Memphis
<br />
ATTN:Josh Weiss
<br />
PO Box 11465
<br />
Memphis,TN 38111
<br />
</div>
<p>Please <strong>do not</strong> write my name on the memo line of the check, but instead, attach a sticky note with “Keaton Burleson” written on it.</p>

<p><em>Any</em> amount will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Even if you are unable to financially contribute, I’d like to ask that you pray for me during this trip, on top of Point of Impact and their amazing staff as a whole.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time,</p>
