<h4 id="note">Note:</h4>
<p>This guide is largely based off <a href="https://gist.github.com/gordonturner/2a2e5ecde5e7860b52e2">https://gist.github.com/gordonturner/2a2e5ecde5e7860b52e2</a>, but adapted for a newer Clover, QEMU, etc.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="setup">Setup:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>An Ubuntu Server running 16.04 LTS
    <ul>
      <li>KVM Capabilities</li>
      <li>QEMU compiled/installed</li>
      <li>OVMF compiled (<a href="https://gist.github.com/gordonturner/85dcc321d2099d610e67">https://gist.github.com/gordonturner/85dcc321d2099d610e67</a>) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">/Build/OvmfX64/DEBUG_GCC49/FV/OVMF.fd</code> put in the base folder of your VM (<code class="highlighter-rouge">bios.bin</code>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A supported Mac that can download 10.11.6 from the Mac App Store</li>
  <li>A 8GB USB Drive</li>
  <li>Clover EFI Bootloader</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-1-creating-the-install-drive">Step 1, creating the install drive:</h2>

<p>With your OS X installer app in /Applications/, run:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">/Applications/Install<span class="se">\ </span>OS<span class="se">\ </span>X<span class="se">\ </span>El<span class="se">\ </span>Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath <span class="s2">"/Applications/Install OS X El Capitan.app"</span>
 </code></pre></figure>

<p>Make sure you substitute <code class="highlighter-rouge">/Volumes/Untitled</code> for your thumb drive (must be formatted as HFS+, GPT). Wait for it to complete, it will take a decent amount of time.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-installing-clover">Step 2, installing Clover:</h2>

<p>After downloading the Clover package, open it, and slowly click through until you see the ‘Customize/Change Install Location’ screen. Change the install location to the flash drive we just created, then click ‘Continue’, and then ‘Customize’. You should have a list presented. Check the box beside ‘Install for UEFI Booting Only’, and open the triangle next to ‘Driver64UEFI’. Check the boxes for <code class="highlighter-rouge">OsxAptioFixDrv-64</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">DataHubDxe-64</code>, then continue with the installation as normal. Now, the EFI partition should still be mounted (EFI in your sidebar). Download <a href="https://github.com/JrCs/CloverGrowerPro/blob/9fc3991c7a82be1a0d096c3a2179098f35b69264/Files/HFSPlus/X64/HFSPlus.efi">this</a> file (HFSPlus.efi) and place it in /Volumes/EFI/EFI/CLOVER/drivers64UEFI/:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> cp ~/Downloads/HFSPlus.efi /Volumes/ESP/EFI/CLOVER/drivers64UEFI/
 </code></pre></figure>

<div class="notice--info">
   
<h4 id="note">Note:</h4>
<p>If you want to have verbose boot (recommended), add <code class="highlighter-rouge">-v</code> to the BootFlags line in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/Volumes/ESP/EFI/CLOVER/config.plist</code> file</p>

 </div>

<h2 id="step-3-getting-the-osk-value">Step 3, getting the OSK value:</h2>

<p>Please see <a href="https://gist.github.com/gordonturner/c33bcc935e32f9fa6695">https://gist.github.com/gordonturner/c33bcc935e32f9fa6695</a> to get the OSK value (must be run from an actual Apple computer). Save this string and keep it safe for later.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-writing-the-flash-drive-to-an-image">Step 4, writing the flash drive to an image:</h2>

<p>Unmount and eject the flash drive from your machine, and plug it back in. Then, unmount the install El Capitan partition. Now, fire up terminal, and type <code class="highlighter-rouge">diskutil list</code>, find your install drive. (Should have two partitions: <code class="highlighter-rouge">EFI</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Install OS X El Capitan</code>).  Record the disk number (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/disk8</code>). <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> into a comfortable folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/Desktop</code>, and run:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> sudo dd <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/rdiskX <span class="nv">of</span><span class="o">=</span>clover-usb-disk.dd
 </code></pre></figure>

<p>Making sure you substitute <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> for your disk number.</p>

<p>After a bit of waiting, you should have a large file on your desktop named <code class="highlighter-rouge">clover-usb-disk.dd</code>, using your own methods, move this file into the root of your vm folder on your server.</p>

<h2 id="step-5-final-setup">Step 5, final setup:</h2>

<p>Now, we absolutely have to be on the Linux machine. Either SSH in, or gain physical access.
At the command line, use this command in your root VM folder:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> sudo qemu-img create -f qcow2 osx-disk0.qcow2 200G
 </code></pre></figure>

<p>Substitute <code class="highlighter-rouge">200G</code> for how many gigs you want, for 500Gb use <code class="highlighter-rouge">500G</code>.</p>

<p>Now, something a bit different, in order for OS X to boot beyond the kernel, we have to disable something:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo su -
<span class="nb">echo </span>1 &gt; /sys/module/kvm/parameters/ignore_msrs</code></pre></figure>

<p>I didn’t do much research into why, but it is important to run that. It is reset every reboot, so putting <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo 1 &gt; /sys/module/kvm/parameters/ignore_msrs</code> into your <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/rc.local</code> file might not be a bad idea.</p>

<h2 id="step-6-first-boot">Step 6, first boot:</h2>

<p>Ok, brace yourself, this is my command to start my VM:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> sudo qemu-system-x86_64 <span class="se">\</span>

<p>Overwhelmed? Probably. Ok, you need to change a couple of things. First, change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$OSK$</code> with your OSK string you saved earlier. Second, change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$VMROOT$</code> occurrences to whatever your VM root is.</p>

<div class="notice--info">
   
<h4 id="note">Note:</h4>
<p>networking is a bit of a beast, but I know you can get it working. I won’t be covering it, but the <a href="https://github.com/pmj/virtio-net-osx">virtio-net</a> driver will help.</p>

 </div>

<p>After those edits, put it into the command line, and cross your fingers.</p>

<h2 id="step-7-connecting-and-installing">Step 7, connecting and installing:</h2>

<p>Now you need to connect to the VNC server that QEMU is hosting for your VM. For OS X, I use <em>Chicken of the VNC</em>, because the Screen Sharing app doesn’t work with the server. Connect to your IP, and port <code class="highlighter-rouge">5901</code>. You should see either the Apple boot screen, the Setup companion, or Clover, depending on how fast you setup your VNC client.</p>

<div class="notice--info">
   
<h4 id="note">Note:</h4>
<p>screen/mouse mapping is broken over the QEMU VNC, you can get through the installer using Tab, Space, and Enter. The same person who wrote the network driver is working on a fix <a href="https://github.com/pmj/QemuUSBTablet-OSX">here</a></p>


 </div>

<p>Use Disk Utility in the installer to format the QEMU HDD, and then run through the installer as normal.</p>

<p>Done!</p>

                 <p>Currently, it is 3:09 AM. I have about three point five hours before my alarm sets off, and yet, I can’t sleep. I usually don’t write about anything concerning politics, life, or anything of solid stature on this site, but today I feel that it is extremely important that I write this. It is no secret that I am a high school student, I’ve proudly stated this on my homepage. Recently, I feel like I’ve been decked by life. Coming to grips with the fact that I’m growing up has been extremely tough. I am in the Boy Scouts of America, and I am soon to becoming an Eagle Scout, the final rank in the Boy Scouts.</p>

<p>Over the past 48 hours, I’ve seen four friends ‘graduate’ to this rank ceremoniously. These friends, half of whom I’ve known for more than half a decade, have been essential to my development. Just watching them, listening to their life plans, worries, and dreams, shell-shocked me. Three years before this, our worries were ‘would there be enough root beer for this campout’ not ‘I hope I can get accepted to this college’. We are all tackling real life problems, and part of me is sad to see these fine young men move on with their lives. Relationships that we’ve built will not stand the test of time. Separate cities, stressful assignments, and eventually abundant families will, unfortunately, slowly erode at our friendships. It is simply life. Three years may not seem like a long time to the average person, but it is a huge transition. From age 14, a boy who loves LEGOs and riding his bike through the woods, to age 17, a young man who is striving for the next thing in life, and all the challenges that come with it. A jump from hiding grass stains on your church shirt to worrying about ACT scores and paychecks. I’m not here to complain, it has been an awesome experience, and I’m glad I’ve been exposed to the challenges, but let me take a moment to discuss the next steps.</p>

<p>College. In this day and age, college is not for everyone. Price is a huge factor in this decision. Our whole lives, we have been taught to go to college, get a degree, and of course, a well-paying job will fall into our lap. Nowadays, we go to college, get a bunch of debt, and get stuck finding a job. I personally believe college will be a great experience, which is why I’m choosing to go to my state’s school, unless I get a good scholarship elsewhere, which brings a segue to my next point.</p>

<p>Diversity. Me, a straight, white, male, is the exact opposite when schools and businesses think of Diversity, which makes me concerned. Not that I’m saying I deserve anything in this world, none of us do, but it feels like we’re (straight, white, males) are being punished for doing something we had no choice over. I didn’t choose my race or my gender. I’m totally fine with who I am, however, I do not check any major boxes, at least from the perspective of colleges and businesses. I am very fortunate to have the job I have now. They hire solely on experience. They do not look first for diversity, but a fit inside the company. They have done an excellent job hiring, all of my coworkers are excellent people. I wouldn’t have it any other way. I am also very grateful for my father, who has helped distinguish me inside my state’s school. They want me to come, which excites me. For the past 17 years of my life, I’ve been comparing myself to others, and I always come up short. For a while, I thought I was a lack luster programmer, until I pieced together the facts. I am a self-made programmer. I’ve never had any classes, nor any formal instruction. All of my knowledge comes from Google. I consider myself proficient. I have three apps on the iOS App Store. The area I live isn’t tech-phobic, but it certainly isn’t a breeding grounds for innovation. For a while, I wanted to go to some fancy CompSci school, but my father asked me: “Do you want to be the light among millions, or the light that shines though the darkness”. With that in mind, I can’t help but feel like I’m on the forefront of a revolution here. There are sometimes I get sad when I see people I follow on Twitter touring, well, Twitter, Google, and getting accepted into awesome tech schools, nothing I could feasibly do. Sure, you could argue that they have some awesome experience, but looking at the location of these people, it is easy to see that they grew up with that being all around them. None of this is to put them down, or make me uppity. I’m not being boastful. Just looking at facts, and maybe getting excited for a renaissance period in my city. Let me finish with this. I’m not going to pretend I have it hard, I’m not going to whine and moan, but let me say this. Growing up is hard, no matter what gender, age, race, or city that person lives in.</p>

                 <p>Well, I went and did it. I made my Power Macintosh 8500 into a Debian web server.
Installing Debian was a bit harder than expected, but thanks to the BootX software, it was eventually installed. The biggest issue was just getting all of the kernels in place.
Here is how my setup works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SCSI drive has a Mac OS 9.1 install, with the BootX app inside of the System Folder.</li>
  <li>ATA card, for my CD drive, and my ATA drive containing the Debian install.</li>
  <li>96MB of RAM in the machine, which is 6MB from the bare minimum for installing/booting Debian.
*</li>
</ul>

<p>I basically just booted the install CD, installed Debian to the ATA drive, shut down the machine, grabbed the kernels off the ATA drive, put them into the folder for BootX, and rebooted into the ATA drive. Also, Debian wouldn’t detect my ethernet port, so I just installed a PCI-X Gigabit card with dual NICs. BootX is great, it really makes this install easier. I couldn’t get the extension to work without the ‘unexpected trap’ error. I can just boot fully into OS 9, then into Debian. You can visit the web server’s homepage here: <a href="http://play.128keaton.com:82/about/">http://play.128keaton.com:82/about/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="q--a">Q &amp; A:</h2>

<p><strong>Q: What about security?</strong></p>

<p>A: This is literally running the latest version of Debian and Apache2.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Well, why?</strong></p>

<p>A: Why not? It was a lot of fun, and quite a challenge.</p>

                 <p>It is not everyday you see someone putting an expensive piece of technology inside of a conventional household oven. But then again, its is not everyday you have to reflow a component.
<em>rock intro</em></p>

<p>Anyway, I received a 2007 MacBook Pro 17” with a bad GPU. Sleep light comes on, no chime, etc. A somewhat common problem among the early MacBook Pro 3,1/4,1 and, the MacBook Pro 8,2, the GPU would desolder itself from the board. No, the GPU wouldn’t physically plop out. Enough solder joints (thanks lead-free) would weaken and disconnect to cause the issue.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.playbackups.com/photos/bga-side-diagram.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The photo above is a simple diagram explaining basic BGA soldering. Those balls are what we are remelting (inside of the oven) to allow a firm connection to be made.</p>

<p>Anyway, I disassembled the MacBook Pro using iFixit’s Logic Board Replacement guide, and began the process of baking. I wouldn’t consider this too outlandish, just because it does work,
but it isn’t permanent. An <del>idiotic</del> butthurt friend did this and still plays video games on it (Battlefield, and other taxing games) and it happened again relatively quick.
 If you keep it from becoming stupid hot, you’ll be fine. Mine idles at 28 degrees Celsius. Anyway, back to baking. I put my board on a tray, on four tin foil balls. 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>What I should’ve done (from a friend):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Placed a sheet of foil underneath</li>
  <li>Cleaned the tray</li>
  <li>Removed the thermal paste from the board.</li>
  <li>Placed one more foil ball underneath a corner.</li>
</ul>

<p>But I didn’t, and thankfully, it turned out ok.</p>

<p>Before baking:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sli.mg/p7cFgz.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sli.mg/ARtTLf.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you can see, there is a bit of board flex. Whoops. Make sure you put a piece of foil under that corner.</p>

<p>Success:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sli.mg/vvqOXN.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>

                 <p>Today, I received a copy of the later 10.7 Beta, build 11A390. The date on the install CD is 2011, and for those who do not know, Lion was officially released July of 2011.</p>

<p>Quickly, I pulled out my trusty 2009 Black MacBook to do a test install. I did, however, try anyway on my MacBookPro1,1, just in case we had a 32-bit EFI bootloader. On initial glance at the DVD, which init of itself is quite amazing, since Lion was never sold on one. Only digital download or on a $20 USB stick (which I own too), there wasn’t any welcome documentation, nor was there the Lion install icon, but something more generic instead.</p>

<p>Just X</p>

<p>Anyway, onto installing. I booted into the installer, and was greeted by the modern ‘OS X Utilities’, but had stylings stuck between Snow Leopard and Lion.</p>

<p>Another weird thing inside of Disk Utility:</p>

<p>The segment control was nothing like I’ve seen before.</p>

<p>Anyway, post installation time, time for setup. We did get the lovely welcome video from Leopard, which was refreshing, even after hearing it a billion times.</p>

<p>First, the background wasn’t the sterile gray, we had a nice picture of Mt. Fiji:</p>

<p>I personally think it looks far better, I never noticed how nice that pic looks.</p>

<p>Then, it gave me the option to add encrypt my disk, something not implemented until 10.10. I wonder why they didn’t do it when they had the option to.</p>

<p>I opted not to, just in case some odd bug arose, which prevented me from exploring the rest of the operating system.</p>

<p>Here we are at the desktop of 10.7, beta! Take note of the Launchpad icon.
Quite ugly, glad it was changed.</p>

<p>I went to About My Mac-&gt;More Info, just to see the build number, and was greeted by this:</p>

<p>Some weird mutant view. I do kinda like it though, not the icons.</p>

<p>The battery view is very nice, I could definitely see this making a come back, maybe with an overall battery health meter, a la CoconutBattery?</p>

<p>Oh, I should probably update that :)</p>

<p>That about wraps it up.</p>
