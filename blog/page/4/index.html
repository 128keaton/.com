                 <p>Welcome back to another segment of ‘Cheap-Oh no!’. Today, we are looking at a power supply that came with a USB-&gt;PATA/IDE/SATA bridge. I burnt out my last one, and I didn’t pay close enough attention to what I’d, unfortunately, purchased. Whoopsie. Honey, I bought a knock-off.</p>

<p>Look at that. ‘Trained Service Personal Only’, I am personally trained in service, yes.</p>

<p>Nothing grabs your attention like HAZARDOUSAREA and ZONEDANGEREUSE.</p>

<p>Oh. Darn. No Servilceable components inside, too bad I am servicing instead.</p>

<p>Lets unscrew the case.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sli.mg/vR5UaV.jpg" alt="Well, ok" /></p>

<p>Except, there aren’t any. Yup, this new, user-friendly design allows you to just <em>pull</em> the case apart, exposing the electrifying innards. Neat!</p>

<p><strong>Case 2/10</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.sli.mg/XvnWmz.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now, lets look at the soldering. Looks like it was thrown together like a monkey on crack, which would explain the working conditions of the rest of the factory. The board, however, looks nicely laid out, from below.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sli.mg/CONQ1P.jpg" alt="Missing?" /></p>

<p>Notice what is missing? Freaking <em>fuses</em>. Have fun with this one, kiddos, it is sure to be a <em>wild</em> ride.</p>

<p><strong>Internals 4/10</strong>*</p>

<p>You know what should’ve tipped me off? The fact that the brand on Amazon was ‘Generic’</p>

<p>Don’t buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Adapter-Converter-Optical-External/dp/B002OV1VJW?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00">this</a>.</p>

                 <p>This has been a heck of a ride. About a week ago, I became annoyed at my cores being eaten up by multiple processes (FCP, AF, PS, Xcode, you get the picture) and decided to future-proof my machine for a mere $99 + free shipping.</p>

<p>I bought a pair of 2.4 GHz, 6 core Xeons to replace my 2.33 GHz, 4 core Xeons inside of my Mac Pro. I bought the extra 2MM of thermal padding, I bought the right hex head (with a proper handle for counting turns).</p>

<p>CPU A went in easy enough, after a bit of tightening. CPU B, however, was a troublesome pain. The Tdiode wasn’t recognized in OS X. I removed, reseated (taking care to clear dust, if any) and retightened. I played the “tighten and pray” ballet more times than I could count, and still no luck.</p>

<p>Finally, I looked at the CPU itself. I knew there was a black mark on the contact, I just though the copper contact was slightly more oxidized and thought nothing of it, until now. The more I looked at it, the more it looked like a burn or something similar.</p>

<h4 id="update">Update:</h4>
<p>Basically, there were three pins that were screwed. My employer was actually able to trade me a 5,1, and the upgrade process went smoothly enough.</p>

                 <p>Oh no! I lost my DSi charger. Well, I guess the $9 one on Amazon is just like the delicious, Japanese, OEM adapter, right? Wrong!</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/56tItYz.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The DSi charger on the table. Lets take a closer look at the outer casing.</p>

<p>Wow! No spelling errors or major red flags. It ‘says’ it outputs at 4.8v, but does it really(nope, 5v give or take)?</p>

<p>Sadly, I have to dock points due to the absolute thinness of the case. Feels like painted cardboard.</p>

<p><strong>8/10 - Casing</strong></p>

<p>Lets tear into the adaptor using our trusty iFixit bit driver.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/t1PvWxq.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Screws out, aaaand:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uVMI2mM.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Poop. I mean, wow, look at that. Don’t do China, kids.</p>

<p>The soldering job is a bit horrendous, and slightly terrible:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/u4ZnlSx.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Adaptor just wouldn’t be complete without bargain bin, factory reject capacitors:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mMnJ1Uq.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Components: 2/10</strong></p>

<p><strong>Overall: 12/20</strong></p>

<p>Unless you are buying the adaptor for the cord (its super easy to desolder, thanks to the kid who soldered it together), don’t bother.</p>

                 <p>Today I was working on a project I had been recruited to do about three weeks ago. I was given a Raspberry Pi preloaded with the project, but I couldn’t remember the password they’d set.</p>

<p>Using Google-fu, I have compiled the complete tutorial to resetting the password on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">pi</code> user.</p>

<p>First, unplug the pi and grab the SD card.</p>

<p>Plug it into your machine (if you have a Micro-SD, get an adaptor).</p>

<p>Then, go to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">boot</code> partition and edit a file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">cmdline.txt</code> and add <code class="highlighter-rouge">init=/bin/sh</code>.</p>

<p>Next, boot the Pi. At the command line, type:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mount -o remount,rw /</code></pre></figure>

<p>Wait for a success message, then type:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">passwd pi</code></pre></figure>

<p>substituting <code class="highlighter-rouge">pi</code> for your username.</p>

<p>It will ask you to enter the new password twice. If all goes well, unplug the Pi, open the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cmdline.txt</code> file on your machine, remove the final line</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">brew install glib pixman</code></p>

<p>Fetch QEMU from their repository:</p>

<p>and unzip:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">tar xvjf qemu-2.5.0.tar.bz2 &amp;&amp; cd qemu-2.5.0</code></p>

<p>then remove the broken pixman library:</p>

<p>Build!</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</code></p>
