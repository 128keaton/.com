                 <p>When dealing with older equipment, one might have to do a hard drive replacement. It is becoming more and more common, as hard drives fail and cease to become writable, or worse-case scenario: readable. The entire PowerBook and iBook line uses a PATA connector to interface with physical storage devices, and then uses an ATA66 or ATA100 bus to manage data transfer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, PATA drives are becoming more and more scarce, and are usually much slower than modern drives. Enter the SSD. Now, SSDs aren’t exactly new technology. Flash storage. has been around for quite a while, but its gaining speed and popularity. Only one problem: most SSDs are SATA. Sure, you could get a PATA SSD, but you would be shelling out major bucks for a small amount of space, and it is nowhere near as fast as modern SSDs. For a while, the typical solution would be to buy an mSATA SSD (or mPCIE) and buy the appropriate adaptor. However, you run into one problem: most mSATA SSDs aren’t backed by quality names, they can be slower, and dodgy. Plus, they are usually a bit pricier than a regular SSD.</p>

<p>I found this: <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/361098025243?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT">the ‘hot adaptor’</a>, and bought it, thinking if it didn’t work, I’d just use in in an X41. The not-so-average reader may have noticed this, but this will make the drive too long. However, in some modern SSDs, the board with the flash storage interface, doesn’t span the whole space available inside of the casing. Simply remove the case, and you are off to the races. I can only attest that this works in an 867MHz TiBook, but I imagine you could easily get this working on other Apple portables.</p>

                 <p>2010, was the year of iOS 4. 2010 was when the iPhone 4 was a flagship phone, a beautiful slab of technology. It was regarded as ‘thin’ and ‘lightweight’. Sound weird? It should.</p>

<p>How far we have fallen.</p>

<p>In 2010, we had a readily available jailbreak for the current iOS. Heck, we had a jailbreak for iOS4 Beta 1, here we are, waiting on a jailbreak for 9.2/9.3.x. Relying on Chinese coder teams to find a single, glorious chink in Apple’s armor.</p>

<p>Here is a good reminder of why we used to jailbreak:</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/T183_PH.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>That, was an iPhone 3G, running iOS 4, with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">homescreen-wallpaper: true</code> line set in <code class="highlighter-rouge">N82AP.plist</code>.</p>

<p>What a miracle.</p>

                 <p>Originally introduced in 1995, the Power Macintosh 8500 was a working class man’s machine. For $4,000, you could buy mini-tower machine with a 120MHz CPU with a FPU. It also had some really nice A/V features, so you could import little Timmy’s birthday from your S-Video camera. All-in-all, not a bad machine. The average going rate for these on eBay are about $39. I picked up two in poor condition for $20, good price. I built up one out of parts of both, but I didn’t really get around to playing with it, until now.</p>

<p>First things first, I opened it up again. No hard drives or caddies. Shame, since is an older SCSI format. No IDE on this old boy. I went to eBay, in search of a decent, and cheap card, and I couldn’t really find a suitable one, until A friend directed me to a generic card, that was advertised as working. I ordered it from China and waited. And waited. However, a week before I got the card, I found something really cool at work.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1625.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>An Adaptec HotConnect 8945, not only for PCs, but it was Macintosh compatible as well.</p>

<p>Sweet!</p>

<p>Lets open that box!</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1669.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Look at all of those goodies.</p>

<p>We have (from bottom to top, left to right):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Registration/readme card.</li>
  <li>User Manual (with a ton of tips and other good information)</li>
  <li>A (new?)SCSI to (older?) SCSI adaptor.</li>
  <li>A FireWire to DV cable.</li>
  <li>The bundled software CD.</li>
  <li>A Windows NT/95 install floppy.</li>
  <li>Molex to bus power.</li>
  <li>Long, gray FireWire cable.</li>
  <li>External SCSI cable.</li>
  <li>Portable SCSI-&gt;Large SCSI Adaptor.</li>
  <li>The card itself (one internal SCSI, one external, 1 internal FireWire, 2 external FireWire).</li>
  <li>One, very long, SCSI cable with a terminator on the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>A very sweet package!</p>

<p>Here is a close shot of the card:</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1672.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Doesn’t really look used at all.</p>

<p>Anyway, onto the upgrading.</p>

<p>First, after trial-and-error, both of my Apple SCSI CD-ROM drives didn’t want to read anything. Wouldn’t spin up worth a darn. From a recommendation, I tried using an IDE CD ROM, with my fancy ATA card, and it worked. I did not believe it. Next, since I was all out of IDE cables long enough, I decided to use the SCSI card too. Hey, its cool, right? I paired it up with a 10,000 RPM (!!!) Jaguar drive that came in a QuickSilver, long broken. I was able to reassemble the case, just fine, and booted the installer. After about five minutes, OS 9.1 was rocking on the 8500.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1679.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Final specs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ATA100 card, with CD-RW drive.</li>
  <li>SCSI card, with 10,000 RPM drive.</li>
  <li>46MB of RAM.</li>
  <li>150MHz CPU, not the lowly 120MHz.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not too shabby.</p>

<p>Maybe sometime soon, I’ll put Tiger on it, along side some more RAM.</p>

<p>Oh, I was also able to solve the Kanga Conundrum. The ATA card I purchased featured an Onboard PATA connector, so I booted into 9.1 and blessed the new drive. Problem solved.</p>

                 <p>Welcome back to another segment of ‘Cheap-Oh no!’. Today, we are looking at a power supply that came with a USB-&gt;PATA/IDE/SATA bridge. I burnt out my last one, and I didn’t pay close enough attention to what I’d, unfortunately, purchased. Whoopsie. Honey, I bought a knock-off.</p>

<p>Look at that. ‘Trained Service Personal Only’, I am personally trained in service, yes.</p>

<p>Nothing grabs your attention like HAZARDOUSAREA and ZONEDANGEREUSE.</p>

<p>Oh. Darn. No Servilceable components inside, too bad I am servicing instead.</p>

<p>Lets unscrew the case.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1659.JPG" alt="Well, ok" /></p>

<p>Except, there aren’t any. Yup, this new, user-friendly design allows you to just <em>pull</em> the case apart, exposing the electrifying innards. Neat!</p>

<p><strong>Case 2/10</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1660.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now, lets look at the soldering. Looks like it was thrown together like a monkey on crack, which would explain the working conditions of the rest of the factory. The board, however, looks nicely laid out, from below.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1661.JPG" alt="Missing?" /></p>

<p>Notice what is missing? Freaking <em>fuses</em>. Have fun with this one, kiddos, it is sure to be a <em>wild</em> ride.</p>

<p><strong>Internals 4/10</strong>*</p>

<p>You know what should’ve tipped me off? The fact that the brand on Amazon was ‘Generic’</p>

<p>Don’t buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Adapter-Converter-Optical-External/dp/B002OV1VJW?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00">this</a>.</p>

                 <p>Oh no! I lost my DSi charger. Well, I guess the $9 one on Amazon is just like the delicious, Japanese, OEM adapter, right? Wrong!</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/56tItYz.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The DSi charger on the table. Lets take a closer look at the outer casing.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/56tItYz.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uVMI2mM.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Wow! No spelling errors or major red flags. It ‘says’ it outputs at 4.8v, but does it really(nope, 5v give or take)?</p>

<p>Sadly, I have to dock points due to the absolute thinness of the case. Feels like painted cardboard.</p>

<p><strong>8/10 - Casing</strong></p>

<p>Lets tear into the adaptor using our trusty iFixit bit driver.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/t1PvWxq.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Screws out, aaaand:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uVMI2mM.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Poop. I mean, wow, look at that. Don’t do China, kids.</p>

<p>The soldering job is a bit horrendous, and slightly terrible:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/u4ZnlSx.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Adaptor just wouldn’t be complete without bargain bin, factory reject capacitors:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/534Spal.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mMnJ1Uq.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Components: 2/10</strong></p>

<p><strong>Overall: 12/20</strong></p>

<p>Unless you are buying the adaptor for the cord (its super easy to desolder, thanks to the kid who soldered it together), don’t bother.</p>
