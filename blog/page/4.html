                 <p>2010, was the year of iOS 4. 2010 was when the iPhone 4 was a flagship phone, a beautiful slab of technology. It was regarded as ‘thin’ and ‘lightweight’. Sound weird? It should.</p>

<p>How far we have fallen.</p>

<p>In 2010, we had a readily available jailbreak for the current iOS. Heck, we had a jailbreak for iOS4 Beta 1, here we are, waiting on a jailbreak for 9.2/9.3.x. Relying on Chinese coder teams to find a single, glorious chink in Apple’s armor.</p>

<p>Here is a good reminder of why we used to jailbreak:</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/T183_PH.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>That, was an iPhone 3G, running iOS 4, with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">homescreen-wallpaper: true</code> line set in <code class="highlighter-rouge">N82AP.plist</code>.</p>

<p>What a miracle.</p>

                 <p>Originally introduced in 1995, the Power Macintosh 8500 was a working class man’s machine. For $4,000, you could buy mini-tower machine with a 120MHz CPU with a FPU. It also had some really nice A/V features, so you could import little Timmy’s birthday from your S-Video camera. All-in-all, not a bad machine. The average going rate for these on eBay are about $39. I picked up two in poor condition for $20, good price. I built up one out of parts of both, but I didn’t really get around to playing with it, until now.</p>

<p>First things first, I opened it up again. No hard drives or caddies. Shame, since is an older SCSI format. No IDE on this old boy. I went to eBay, in search of a decent, and cheap card, and I couldn’t really find a suitable one, until A friend directed me to a generic card, that was advertised as working. I ordered it from China and waited. And waited. However, a week before I got the card, I found something really cool at work.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1625.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>An Adaptec HotConnect 8945, not only for PCs, but it was Macintosh compatible as well.</p>

<p>Sweet!</p>

<p>Lets open that box!</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1669.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Look at all of those goodies.</p>

<p>We have (from bottom to top, left to right):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Registration/readme card.</li>
  <li>User Manual (with a ton of tips and other good information)</li>
  <li>A (new?)SCSI to (older?) SCSI adaptor.</li>
  <li>A FireWire to DV cable.</li>
  <li>The bundled software CD.</li>
  <li>A Windows NT/95 install floppy.</li>
  <li>Molex to bus power.</li>
  <li>Long, gray FireWire cable.</li>
  <li>External SCSI cable.</li>
  <li>Portable SCSI-&gt;Large SCSI Adaptor.</li>
  <li>The card itself (one internal SCSI, one external, 1 internal FireWire, 2 external FireWire).</li>
  <li>One, very long, SCSI cable with a terminator on the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>A very sweet package!</p>

<p>Here is a close shot of the card:</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1672.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Doesn’t really look used at all.</p>

<p>Anyway, onto the upgrading.</p>

<p>First, after trial-and-error, both of my Apple SCSI CD-ROM drives didn’t want to read anything. Wouldn’t spin up worth a darn. From a recommendation, I tried using an IDE CD ROM, with my fancy ATA card, and it worked. I did not believe it. Next, since I was all out of IDE cables long enough, I decided to use the SCSI card too. Hey, its cool, right? I paired it up with a 10,000 RPM (!!!) Jaguar drive that came in a QuickSilver, long broken. I was able to reassemble the case, just fine, and booted the installer. After about five minutes, OS 9.1 was rocking on the 8500.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1679.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Final specs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ATA100 card, with CD-RW drive.</li>
  <li>SCSI card, with 10,000 RPM drive.</li>
  <li>46MB of RAM.</li>
  <li>150MHz CPU, not the lowly 120MHz.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not too shabby.</p>

<p>Maybe sometime soon, I’ll put Tiger on it, along side some more RAM.</p>

<p>Oh, I was also able to solve the Kanga Conundrum. The ATA card I purchased featured an Onboard PATA connector, so I booted into 9.1 and blessed the new drive. Problem solved.</p>

                 <p>Welcome back to another segment of ‘Cheap-Oh no!’. Today, we are looking at a power supply that came with a USB-&gt;PATA/IDE/SATA bridge. I burnt out my last one, and I didn’t pay close enough attention to what I’d, unfortunately, purchased. Whoopsie. Honey, I bought a knock-off.</p>

<p>Look at that. ‘Trained Service Personal Only’, I am personally trained in service, yes.</p>

<p>Nothing grabs your attention like HAZARDOUSAREA and ZONEDANGEREUSE.</p>

<p>Oh. Darn. No Servilceable components inside, too bad I am servicing instead.</p>

<p>Lets unscrew the case.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1659.JPG" alt="Well, ok" /></p>

<p>Except, there aren’t any. Yup, this new, user-friendly design allows you to just <em>pull</em> the case apart, exposing the electrifying innards. Neat!</p>

<p><strong>Case 2/10</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1660.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now, lets look at the soldering. Looks like it was thrown together like a monkey on crack, which would explain the working conditions of the rest of the factory. The board, however, looks nicely laid out, from below.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1661.JPG" alt="Missing?" /></p>

<p>Notice what is missing? Freaking <em>fuses</em>. Have fun with this one, kiddos, it is sure to be a <em>wild</em> ride.</p>

<p><strong>Internals 4/10</strong>*</p>

<p>You know what should’ve tipped me off? The fact that the brand on Amazon was ‘Generic’</p>

<p>Don’t buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Adapter-Converter-Optical-External/dp/B002OV1VJW?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00">this</a>.</p>

                 <p>This has been a heck of a ride. About a week ago, I became annoyed at my cores being eaten up by multiple processes (FCP, AF, PS, Xcode, you get the picture) and decided to future-proof my machine for a mere $99 + free shipping.</p>

<p>I bought a pair of 2.4 GHz, 6 core Xeons to replace my 2.33 GHz, 4 core Xeons inside of my Mac Pro. I bought the extra 2MM of thermal padding, I bought the right hex head (with a proper handle for counting turns).</p>

<p>CPU A went in easy enough, after a bit of tightening. CPU B, however, was a troublesome pain. The Tdiode wasn’t recognized in OS X. I removed, reseated (taking care to clear dust, if any) and retightened. I played the “tighten and pray” ballet more times than I could count, and still no luck.</p>

<p>Finally, I looked at the CPU itself. I knew there was a black mark on the contact, I just though the copper contact was slightly more oxidized and thought nothing of it, until now. The more I looked at it, the more it looked like a burn or something similar.</p>

<div class="notice--update">
  
<h4 id="update">Update:</h4>
<p>Basically, there were three pins that were screwed. My employer was actually able to trade me a 5,1, and the upgrade process went smoothly enough.</p>

                 <p>Oh no! I lost my DSi charger. Well, I guess the $9 one on Amazon is just like the delicious, Japanese, OEM adapter, right? Wrong!</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/56tItYz.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The DSi charger on the table. Lets take a closer look at the outer casing.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uVMI2mM.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Wow! No spelling errors or major red flags. It ‘says’ it outputs at 4.8v, but does it really(nope, 5v give or take)?</p>

<p>Sadly, I have to dock points due to the absolute thinness of the case. Feels like painted cardboard.</p>

<p><strong>8/10 - Casing</strong></p>

<p>Lets tear into the adaptor using our trusty iFixit bit driver.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/t1PvWxq.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Screws out, aaaand:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uVMI2mM.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Poop. I mean, wow, look at that. Don’t do China, kids.</p>

<p>The soldering job is a bit horrendous, and slightly terrible:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/u4ZnlSx.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The Adaptor just wouldn’t be complete without bargain bin, factory reject capacitors:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/534Spal.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mMnJ1Uq.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Components: 2/10</strong></p>

<p><strong>Overall: 12/20</strong></p>

<p>Unless you are buying the adaptor for the cord (its super easy to desolder, thanks to the kid who soldered it together), don’t bother.</p>
