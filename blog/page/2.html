<p>I’m a bit disappointed. Mozilla makes a couple of great things (Firefox, Rust, MDN, …). But in contrast to their products, I have a quite bad impression of their Foundation and/or Corporation. I don’t know if it is warranted or not, but I have the impression that they mostly exist to burn through the millions they get from Google for setting them as default search engine.</p>

</div>

<p>This is exactly why they are trying to rebrand themselves, to move away from preconceived notions, similar to yours. Not that I’m advocating for the Mozilla Foundation, but that is exactly right</p>

<div class="notice--quote">


<p>This new branding doesn’t help at all with my perception of Mozilla. If anything, it emphasizes the perception that Mozilla is a bloated entity disconnected from the products I care about. That they put a nerdy “://” in there to appeal technical means to me that they are even aware of this.</p>

</div>

<p>And that is where they steered themselves wrong. Most college-age students, people that they seem to be gunning for with the horror-show of meme images, use Chrome, and Chromebooks, or Safari. I personally use Firefox, but they just keep falling short of my expectations. Now, I love this next bit</p>

<div class="notice--quote">


<p>What I would have done is to go back to the early 2000s unapologetically retro dinosaur. This was from a time when Mozilla was the underdog, when it was the Free alternative, when it was getting better and better, and when Firefox was invented.</p>

</div>

<p>The only problem with that is no one they want to use their browser will understand this, plus Firefox hasn’t gotten better for a long time.</p>

                 <p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/coolbooter">Coolbooter</a>, we can now downgrade to any capable versions that our 32-bit iDevices can run (iPad 2-4, iPhone 4-5c), but what if you have an iPhone that is iCloud locked?</p>

<div class="notice--info">
  
<h4 id="note">Note:</h4>
<p>Now, this isn’t a ‘work-around’ per-se, just a way to get to the homescreen. Activation and whatnot is NOT guaranteed with this method, and you need to have the phone already jailbroken and you need to have homescreen access, i.e. no passcode. Coolbooter is in beta. BETA! It might break your phone.</p>

<p>Also, this has only been tested on iOS 6. ymmv.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="step-1---installing-coolbooter">Step 1 - Installing Coolbooter.</h2>

<p>If you haven’t already, add the Coolbooter repo to Cydia (https://coolbooter.com) and install the Coolbooter Beta package. It’s pretty straightforward.</p>

<h2 id="step-2---d-d-d-downgrading">Step 2 - D-d-d-downgrading.</h2>

<p>Select the version you want to install (once again, only tested on iOS 6) and install. Coolbooter takes a decent amount of time to download, parition and move everything into place. Then tap ‘Boot’ and boot into iOS 6. Run through the setup to verify that you can’t log in to the locked account.</p>

<h2 id="step-3---installing-openssh-because-if-you-didnt-you-are-doing-it-wrong">Step 3 - Installing OpenSSH (because if you didn’t you are doing it wrong).</h2>

<p>Boot back into your main OS (just shut down and turn back on) and install ‘OpenSSH’ in Cydia. If you don’t know how to SSH into your own device, then stop right here and contemplate your life choices and return at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="note-change-your-openssh-root-password-using-passwd">Note: change your OpenSSH root password using <code class="highlighter-rouge">passwd</code></h3>

<div id="stahp">

## Step 3a - Contemplating your life choices.

Are you one of those people who post on /r/jailbreak like its your personal Google? Stop it. You are bad. Do you reply to @qwertyuiop's tweets asking 'eta wen' or other begging crap? Stop it. You are bad.

</div>

<h2 id="step-4---mounting-the-secondary-partition">Step 4 - Mounting the secondary partition.</h2>

<p>First, list your devices or partitions in your SSH session with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls /dev/</code>, I’d bet some serious money your iOS 6 partition is something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/disk0s1s3</code>. If a mounting point (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt</code>) doesn’t exist, make one with <code class="highlighter-rouge">mkdir /mnt</code>. Finally, run:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> mount -t hfs /dev/disk0s1s3 /mnt</code></pre></figure>

<p>Substitute <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/disk0s1s3</code> for your device.</p>

<h2 id="step-5---removing-the-setup-app">Step 5 - Removing the setup app.</h2>

<p>We’re almost DUNNN. Just run:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd</span> /mnt/Applications <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> rm -rf Setup.app</code></pre></figure>

<p>Boot back into your secondary OS and you should see a lockscreen instead of a setup screen</p>

<p>If you broke some stuff, sorry, your fault</p>

                 <p>The Kindle Keyboard 3, or Kindle 3, is absolutely one of my favorite Kindles.</p>

<p>It features a full keyboard (SYM key gives you punctation), sports a Linux kernel (you can actually run Debian on them), easily jailbreakable, weighted properly, and has physical page buttons.</p>

<p>They are one of the last easily serviceable e-readers from Amazon.</p>

<p>They are very cheap on eBay and are still able to sync with your Amazon account easily, some of the special models even have 3G. Having 3G is especially handy since you now have a remote terminal with Debian. SSH into any server on the fly! The one fatal flaw the device has is the screen. While it isn’t too expensive to replace ($25), you have to dissassemble the entire device. Thankfully, there are only two screws and one ribbon cable, plus prying off the snap-on plastic back. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Kindle+3+Screen+Replacement/29843">iFixit</a> has you covered. My only tips are, just undo the orange ribbon cable (see photo).
<img src="https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/YJW3xKyWIxFHOucJ.medium" alt=":D" /></p>

<p>And on step 7/8 take out the motherboard and plate as a whole.</p>

<p>I have two sitting waiting for new screens. I plan to give them as Christmas gifts since I believe they are much more utilitarian than the newer ones. In the future, I plan to make a reading light attachment, but thats all in the future.</p>

<p>Now, I bought two new screens from an eBay seller (unnamed for privacy). After assembling, I noticed some very frustrating ghosting on the screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sli.mg/RV9EDW.jpg" alt=":()" /><img src="https://i.sli.mg/bFM35I.jpg" alt=":()" /></p>

<p>From now on, I’ll buy my screens from PowerBookMedic, which has a great selection of Kindle parts. You could basically build one out of their inventory. I ended up buying two new faceplates and backs for $8.00. I will be going to the post office to ship the faulty screens back and hopefully buying a quality set of screens. I will update as soon as I get them installed.</p>

<h4 id="note">Note:</h4>
<p>This guide is largely based off <a href="https://gist.github.com/gordonturner/2a2e5ecde5e7860b52e2">https://gist.github.com/gordonturner/2a2e5ecde5e7860b52e2</a>, but adapted for a newer Clover, QEMU, etc.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="setup">Setup:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>An Ubuntu Server running 16.04 LTS
    <ul>
      <li>KVM Capabilities</li>
      <li>QEMU compiled/installed</li>
      <li>OVMF compiled (<a href="https://gist.github.com/gordonturner/85dcc321d2099d610e67">https://gist.github.com/gordonturner/85dcc321d2099d610e67</a>) and <code class="highlighter-rouge">/Build/OvmfX64/DEBUG_GCC49/FV/OVMF.fd</code> put in the base folder of your VM (<code class="highlighter-rouge">bios.bin</code>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A supported Mac that can download 10.11.6 from the Mac App Store</li>
  <li>A 8GB USB Drive</li>
  <li>Clover EFI Bootloader</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="step-1-creating-the-install-drive">Step 1, creating the install drive:</h2>

<p>With your OS X installer app in /Applications/, run:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">/Applications/Install<span class="se">\ </span>OS<span class="se">\ </span>X<span class="se">\ </span>El<span class="se">\ </span>Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Untitled --applicationpath <span class="s2">"/Applications/Install OS X El Capitan.app"</span>
 </code></pre></figure>

<p>Make sure you substitute <code class="highlighter-rouge">/Volumes/Untitled</code> for your thumb drive (must be formatted as HFS+, GPT). Wait for it to complete, it will take a decent amount of time.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-installing-clover">Step 2, installing Clover:</h2>

<p>After downloading the Clover package, open it, and slowly click through until you see the ‘Customize/Change Install Location’ screen. Change the install location to the flash drive we just created, then click ‘Continue’, and then ‘Customize’. You should have a list presented. Check the box beside ‘Install for UEFI Booting Only’, and open the triangle next to ‘Driver64UEFI’. Check the boxes for <code class="highlighter-rouge">OsxAptioFixDrv-64</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">DataHubDxe-64</code>, then continue with the installation as normal. Now, the EFI partition should still be mounted (EFI in your sidebar). Download <a href="https://github.com/JrCs/CloverGrowerPro/blob/9fc3991c7a82be1a0d096c3a2179098f35b69264/Files/HFSPlus/X64/HFSPlus.efi">this</a> file (HFSPlus.efi) and place it in /Volumes/EFI/EFI/CLOVER/drivers64UEFI/:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> cp ~/Downloads/HFSPlus.efi /Volumes/ESP/EFI/CLOVER/drivers64UEFI/
 </code></pre></figure>

<div class="notice--info">
   
<h4 id="note">Note:</h4>
<p>If you want to have verbose boot (recommended), add <code class="highlighter-rouge">-v</code> to the BootFlags line in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/Volumes/ESP/EFI/CLOVER/config.plist</code> file</p>

 </div>

<h2 id="step-3-getting-the-osk-value">Step 3, getting the OSK value:</h2>

<p>Please see <a href="https://gist.github.com/gordonturner/c33bcc935e32f9fa6695">https://gist.github.com/gordonturner/c33bcc935e32f9fa6695</a> to get the OSK value (must be run from an actual Apple computer). Save this string and keep it safe for later.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-writing-the-flash-drive-to-an-image">Step 4, writing the flash drive to an image:</h2>

<p>Unmount and eject the flash drive from your machine, and plug it back in. Then, unmount the install El Capitan partition. Now, fire up terminal, and type <code class="highlighter-rouge">diskutil list</code>, find your install drive. (Should have two partitions: <code class="highlighter-rouge">EFI</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Install OS X El Capitan</code>).  Record the disk number (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/disk8</code>). <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code> into a comfortable folder <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/Desktop</code>, and run:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> sudo dd <span class="k">if</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/rdiskX <span class="nv">of</span><span class="o">=</span>clover-usb-disk.dd
 </code></pre></figure>

<p>Making sure you substitute <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> for your disk number.</p>

<p>After a bit of waiting, you should have a large file on your desktop named <code class="highlighter-rouge">clover-usb-disk.dd</code>, using your own methods, move this file into the root of your vm folder on your server.</p>

<h2 id="step-5-final-setup">Step 5, final setup:</h2>

<p>Now, we absolutely have to be on the Linux machine. Either SSH in, or gain physical access.
At the command line, use this command in your root VM folder:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> sudo qemu-img create -f qcow2 osx-disk0.qcow2 200G
 </code></pre></figure>

<p>Substitute <code class="highlighter-rouge">200G</code> for how many gigs you want, for 500Gb use <code class="highlighter-rouge">500G</code>.</p>

<p>Now, something a bit different, in order for OS X to boot beyond the kernel, we have to disable something:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo su -
<span class="nb">echo </span>1 &gt; /sys/module/kvm/parameters/ignore_msrs</code></pre></figure>

<p>I didn’t do much research into why, but it is important to run that. It is reset every reboot, so putting <code class="highlighter-rouge">echo 1 &gt; /sys/module/kvm/parameters/ignore_msrs</code> into your <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/rc.local</code> file might not be a bad idea.</p>

<h2 id="step-6-first-boot">Step 6, first boot:</h2>

<p>Ok, brace yourself, this is my command to start my VM:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> sudo qemu-system-x86_64 <span class="se">\</span>

<p>Overwhelmed? Probably. Ok, you need to change a couple of things. First, change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$OSK$</code> with your OSK string you saved earlier. Second, change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$VMROOT$</code> occurrences to whatever your VM root is.</p>

<div class="notice--info">
   
<h4 id="note">Note:</h4>
<p>networking is a bit of a beast, but I know you can get it working. I won’t be covering it, but the <a href="https://github.com/pmj/virtio-net-osx">virtio-net</a> driver will help.</p>

 </div>

<p>After those edits, put it into the command line, and cross your fingers.</p>

<h2 id="step-7-connecting-and-installing">Step 7, connecting and installing:</h2>

<p>Now you need to connect to the VNC server that QEMU is hosting for your VM. For OS X, I use <em>Chicken of the VNC</em>, because the Screen Sharing app doesn’t work with the server. Connect to your IP, and port <code class="highlighter-rouge">5901</code>. You should see either the Apple boot screen, the Setup companion, or Clover, depending on how fast you setup your VNC client.</p>

<div class="notice--info">
   
<h4 id="note">Note:</h4>
<p>screen/mouse mapping is broken over the QEMU VNC, you can get through the installer using Tab, Space, and Enter. The same person who wrote the network driver is working on a fix <a href="https://github.com/pmj/QemuUSBTablet-OSX">here</a></p>


 </div>

<p>Use Disk Utility in the installer to format the QEMU HDD, and then run through the installer as normal.</p>

<p>Done!</p>

                 <p>Currently, it is 3:09 AM. I have about three point five hours before my alarm sets off, and yet, I can’t sleep. I usually don’t write about anything concerning politics, life, or anything of solid stature on this site, but today I feel that it is extremely important that I write this. It is no secret that I am a high school student, I’ve proudly stated this on my homepage. Recently, I feel like I’ve been decked by life. Coming to grips with the fact that I’m growing up has been extremely tough. I am in the Boy Scouts of America, and I am soon to becoming an Eagle Scout, the final rank in the Boy Scouts.</p>

<p>Over the past 48 hours, I’ve seen four friends ‘graduate’ to this rank ceremoniously. These friends, half of whom I’ve known for more than half a decade, have been essential to my development. Just watching them, listening to their life plans, worries, and dreams, shell-shocked me. Three years before this, our worries were ‘would there be enough root beer for this campout’ not ‘I hope I can get accepted to this college’. We are all tackling real life problems, and part of me is sad to see these fine young men move on with their lives. Relationships that we’ve built will not stand the test of time. Separate cities, stressful assignments, and eventually abundant families will, unfortunately, slowly erode at our friendships. It is simply life. Three years may not seem like a long time to the average person, but it is a huge transition. From age 14, a boy who loves LEGOs and riding his bike through the woods, to age 17, a young man who is striving for the next thing in life, and all the challenges that come with it. A jump from hiding grass stains on your church shirt to worrying about ACT scores and paychecks. I’m not here to complain, it has been an awesome experience, and I’m glad I’ve been exposed to the challenges, but let me take a moment to discuss the next steps.</p>

<p>College. In this day and age, college is not for everyone. Price is a huge factor in this decision. Our whole lives, we have been taught to go to college, get a degree, and of course, a well-paying job will fall into our lap. Nowadays, we go to college, get a bunch of debt, and get stuck finding a job. I personally believe college will be a great experience, which is why I’m choosing to go to my state’s school, unless I get a good scholarship elsewhere, which brings a segue to my next point.</p>

<p>Diversity. Me, a straight, white, male, is the exact opposite when schools and businesses think of Diversity, which makes me concerned. Not that I’m saying I deserve anything in this world, none of us do, but it feels like we’re (straight, white, males) are being punished for doing something we had no choice over. I didn’t choose my race or my gender. I’m totally fine with who I am, however, I do not check any major boxes, at least from the perspective of colleges and businesses. I am very fortunate to have the job I have now. They hire solely on experience. They do not look first for diversity, but a fit inside the company. They have done an excellent job hiring, all of my coworkers are excellent people. I wouldn’t have it any other way. I am also very grateful for my father, who has helped distinguish me inside my state’s school. They want me to come, which excites me. For the past 17 years of my life, I’ve been comparing myself to others, and I always come up short. For a while, I thought I was a lack luster programmer, until I pieced together the facts. I am a self-made programmer. I’ve never had any classes, nor any formal instruction. All of my knowledge comes from Google. I consider myself proficient. I have three apps on the iOS App Store. The area I live isn’t tech-phobic, but it certainly isn’t a breeding grounds for innovation. For a while, I wanted to go to some fancy CompSci school, but my father asked me: “Do you want to be the light among millions, or the light that shines though the darkness”. With that in mind, I can’t help but feel like I’m on the forefront of a revolution here. There are sometimes I get sad when I see people I follow on Twitter touring, well, Twitter, Google, and getting accepted into awesome tech schools, nothing I could feasibly do. Sure, you could argue that they have some awesome experience, but looking at the location of these people, it is easy to see that they grew up with that being all around them. None of this is to put them down, or make me uppity. I’m not being boastful. Just looking at facts, and maybe getting excited for a renaissance period in my city. Let me finish with this. I’m not going to pretend I have it hard, I’m not going to whine and moan, but let me say this. Growing up is hard, no matter what gender, age, race, or city that person lives in.</p>
