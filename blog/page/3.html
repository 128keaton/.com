                 <p>Today, I received a copy of the later 10.7 Beta, build 11A390. The date on the install CD is 2011, and for those who do not know, Lion was officially released July of 2011.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/Slack for iOS Upload.jpg" alt="Lion 2011 Beta" /></p>

<p>Quickly, I pulled out my trusty 2009 Black MacBook to do a test install. I did, however, try anyway on my MacBookPro1,1, just in case we had a 32-bit EFI bootloader. On initial glance at the DVD, which init of itself is quite amazing, since Lion was never sold on one. Only digital download or on a $20 USB stick (which I own too), there wasn’t any welcome documentation, nor was there the Lion install icon, but something more generic instead.</p>

<p>Just X</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Anyway, onto installing. I booted into the installer, and was greeted by the modern ‘OS X Utilities’, but had stylings stuck between Snow Leopard and Lion.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1819.JPG" alt="Mac OS X Utilities" /></p>

<p>Another weird thing inside of Disk Utility:</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1821.JPG" alt="UISegmentedControl" /></p>

<p>The segment control was nothing like I’ve seen before.</p>

<p>Anyway, post installation time, time for setup. We did get the lovely welcome video from Leopard, which was refreshing, even after hearing it a billion times.</p>

<p>First, the background wasn’t the sterile gray, we had a nice picture of Mt. Fiji:</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1825.JPG" alt="Mt Feejee" /></p>

<p>I personally think it looks far better, I never noticed how nice that pic looks.</p>

<p>Then, it gave me the option to add encrypt my disk, something not implemented until 10.10. I wonder why they didn’t do it when they had the option to.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1827.JPG" alt="Yosemite? Anyone?" /></p>

<p>I opted not to, just in case some odd bug arose, which prevented me from exploring the rest of the operating system.</p>

<p>Here we are at the desktop of 10.7, beta! Take note of the Launchpad icon.
Quite ugly, glad it was changed.</p>

<p>I went to About My Mac-&gt;More Info, just to see the build number, and was greeted by this:</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/Screen Shot 2016-05-16 at 10.01.55 PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some weird mutant view. I do kinda like it though, not the icons.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/Screen Shot 2016-05-16 at 10.02.02 PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The battery view is very nice, I could definitely see this making a come back, maybe with an overall battery health meter, a la CoconutBattery?</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/Screen Shot 2016-05-16 at 10.05.52 PM.png" alt="TM" /></p>

<p>Time Machine also had a few surprises, it had the option to store hourly snapshots locally, and daily backups on a Time Machine drive/server. Once again, if properly working, I’d love that to make a reappearance.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/Screen Shot 2016-05-16 at 10.07.23 PM.png" alt="Software updates" /></p>

<p>Oh, I should probably update that :)</p>

<p>That about wraps it up.</p>

            <div class="post-text">
                 <p>Today I received a ShuttleX PC. It is a small form-factor machine, with a custom board. Smaller than an ITX board, the custom motherboard inside of the ShuttleX features a PCI and AGP slot, 2xDDR2 RAM slots, and a Pentium 4 CPU. Although, not too powerful, it is still a very cool machine. However, it has been a long-time dream of mine to have a PC that is easily carried around. This one fits in my backpack.</p>

<p>Anyway, onto the modification. A penalty of doing an ITX mod is that you lose a PCI-E slot. Not on your board, but on the outside of the case. The custom motherboard is designed in such a way, that there are two slots, but it is one slot too close. Instead of brutally hacking at the case until something happens, I decided to make the GPU of choice a ‘low profile’ card.</p>

<p>Speaking of the GPU choice, I have a spare GTX650 I am going to use.</p>

<p>It is an EVGA ‘SuperClocked’ card, and it is pretty snappy for most games. CS-GO doesn’t need much, you guys.</p>

<h2 id="disassembly">Disassembly:</h2>

<p>First, taking the card apart:</p>

<p>There are four screws ‘under’ the fan blades, and one ‘holding’ the PCIE cover on. Remove those and the case.</p>

<p>Now, finding a card that has a similar port layout.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1787.JPG" alt="Comparing ports" /></p>

<p>I found something that worked, well with enough work. I do not know what/where it came from, but it was one of those OEM Dell cards with the multi-monitor port.</p>

<p>I removed the bracket from the GTX 650 as well, so I could trace the ports and cut to spec, not hard in theory.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1788.JPG" alt="The bracket" /></p>

<h2 id="modding">Modding:</h2>

<p>Here is the card in its ‘pre surgical’ state. The black marks are simply permanent marker marks.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1789.JPG" alt="All marked up" /></p>

<p>And its ‘post surgical state’. She isn’t pretty yet. I just used a drill bit to remove the majority of the metal, and I’ll file/cut finer with a Dremel.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1790.JPG" alt="After some drilling and, well, not filling" /></p>

<p>For some reason, I didn’t get a between photo, but I just used a Dremel cutting wheel and polishing wedge to get the job done. The port was shaped decently so.</p>

<p>Here is a photo of me comparing with the OEM card inside of the ShuttleX. The port layout works fine!</p>

<h2 id="final-product">Final Product:</h2>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1791.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>I do not know temperatures yet, or if I’ll need a fan. Time will tell.</p>

<h3 id="background-info">Background Info:</h3>
<p>When I was diagnosed as diabetic, I struggled to find a diabetes application that fit my criteria. I needed it to sync with HealthKit, calculate my meals, and allow me to share my data with my doctor.</p>

<p>There is one other application that comes close, but it requires a subscription, and quite frankly, it was terribly designed.</p>

<h3 id="apistechnologies">APIs/Technologies:</h3>
<p>I chose HealthKit because of its seamless integration into iOS. I really wanted something that, if in the future, I had to use an application for an insulin pump, I could also use my application. The only thing I would add to HealthKit is insulin units. I could’ve stored all of my information inside of HealthKit, but I had to make an external data source (NSMutableDictionary inside of an [NSMutableDictionary]). Last minute, I chose to make an Apple Watch companion. The documentation made it really easy to add that feature, along with the Today Extension.</p>

<h3 id="issues">Issues:</h3>
<p>This is my first ‘real’ Swift application, and I have to say, I’m glad I learned the language. Objective-C is almost archaic in comparison. I did encounter a few bugs while working with dictionary and arrays (array[row][key] would crash the compiler and WYSIWYG editor), but a restart of Xcode usually fixed it temporarily. My biggest issue was keeping the data synced up properly. NSUserDefaults was a good idea, but I probably should have used CoreData in the end.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-would-change">What I would change:</h3>
<p>When I first  started this project, I didn’t for-see it becoming this large (over 2000 lines of code). If I had more time, I’d definitely migrate to CoreData and implement an iCloud syncing metric. I’d also make the Apple Watch companion more in-depth as well. There is definitely room for UI changes, I feel that some aspects of the dashboard could be improved upon, but for how much data I made fit into the main screen, I think I did a good job.</p>

<div class="notice--update">
  
<p>Update: I was not chosen to visit WWDC 2016. Go ahead and have a glimpse at the winners. I am sad, for sure, that they picked a multi-year student over a first-time applicant. I am, however, moving to get Test Strip in the app store.</p>

                 <p>When dealing with older equipment, one might have to do a hard drive replacement. It is becoming more and more common, as hard drives fail and cease to become writable, or worse-case scenario: readable. The entire PowerBook and iBook line uses a PATA connector to interface with physical storage devices, and then uses an ATA66 or ATA100 bus to manage data transfer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, PATA drives are becoming more and more scarce, and are usually much slower than modern drives. Enter the SSD. Now, SSDs aren’t exactly new technology. Flash storage. has been around for quite a while, but its gaining speed and popularity. Only one problem: most SSDs are SATA. Sure, you could get a PATA SSD, but you would be shelling out major bucks for a small amount of space, and it is nowhere near as fast as modern SSDs. For a while, the typical solution would be to buy an mSATA SSD (or mPCIE) and buy the appropriate adaptor. However, you run into one problem: most mSATA SSDs aren’t backed by quality names, they can be slower, and dodgy. Plus, they are usually a bit pricier than a regular SSD.</p>

<p>I found this: <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/361098025243?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&amp;ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT">the ‘hot adaptor’</a>, and bought it, thinking if it didn’t work, I’d just use in in an X41. The not-so-average reader may have noticed this, but this will make the drive too long. However, in some modern SSDs, the board with the flash storage interface, doesn’t span the whole space available inside of the casing. Simply remove the case, and you are off to the races. I can only attest that this works in an 867MHz TiBook, but I imagine you could easily get this working on other Apple portables.</p>

                 <p>2010, was the year of iOS 4. 2010 was when the iPhone 4 was a flagship phone, a beautiful slab of technology. It was regarded as ‘thin’ and ‘lightweight’. Sound weird? It should.</p>

<p>How far we have fallen.</p>

<p>In 2010, we had a readily available jailbreak for the current iOS. Heck, we had a jailbreak for iOS4 Beta 1, here we are, waiting on a jailbreak for 9.2/9.3.x. Relying on Chinese coder teams to find a single, glorious chink in Apple’s armor.</p>

<p>Here is a good reminder of why we used to jailbreak:</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/T183_PH.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>That, was an iPhone 3G, running iOS 4, with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">homescreen-wallpaper: true</code> line set in <code class="highlighter-rouge">N82AP.plist</code>.</p>

<p>What a miracle.</p>
