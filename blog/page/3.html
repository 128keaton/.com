                 <p>Well, I went and did it. I made my Power Macintosh 8500 into a Debian web server.
Installing Debian was a bit harder than expected, but thanks to the BootX software, it was eventually installed. The biggest issue was just getting all of the kernels in place.
Here is how my setup works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SCSI drive has a Mac OS 9.1 install, with the BootX app inside of the System Folder.</li>
  <li>ATA card, for my CD drive, and my ATA drive containing the Debian install.</li>
  <li>96MB of RAM in the machine, which is 6MB from the bare minimum for installing/booting Debian.
*</li>
</ul>

<p>I basically just booted the install CD, installed Debian to the ATA drive, shut down the machine, grabbed the kernels off the ATA drive, put them into the folder for BootX, and rebooted into the ATA drive. Also, Debian wouldn’t detect my ethernet port, so I just installed a PCI-X Gigabit card with dual NICs. BootX is great, it really makes this install easier. I couldn’t get the extension to work without the ‘unexpected trap’ error. I can just boot fully into OS 9, then into Debian. You can visit the web server’s homepage here: <a href="http://play.128keaton.com:82/about/">http://play.128keaton.com:82/about/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="q--a">Q &amp; A:</h2>

<p><strong>Q: What about security?</strong></p>

<p>A: This is literally running the latest version of Debian and Apache2.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Well, why?</strong></p>

<p>A: Why not? It was a lot of fun, and quite a challenge.</p>

                 <p>It is not everyday you see someone putting an expensive piece of technology inside of a conventional household oven. But then again, its is not everyday you have to reflow a component.
<em>rock intro</em></p>

<p>Anyway, I received a 2007 MacBook Pro 17” with a bad GPU. Sleep light comes on, no chime, etc. A somewhat common problem among the early MacBook Pro 3,1/4,1 and, the MacBook Pro 8,2, the GPU would desolder itself from the board. No, the GPU wouldn’t physically plop out. Enough solder joints (thanks lead-free) would weaken and disconnect to cause the issue.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.playbackups.com/photos/bga-side-diagram.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The photo above is a simple diagram explaining basic BGA soldering. Those balls are what we are remelting (inside of the oven) to allow a firm connection to be made.</p>

<p>Anyway, I disassembled the MacBook Pro using iFixit’s Logic Board Replacement guide, and began the process of baking. I wouldn’t consider this too outlandish, just because it does work,
but it isn’t permanent. An <del>idiotic</del> butthurt friend did this and still plays video games on it (Battlefield, and other taxing games) and it happened again relatively quick.
 If you keep it from becoming stupid hot, you’ll be fine. Mine idles at 28 degrees Celsius. Anyway, back to baking. I put my board on a tray, on four tin foil balls. 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>What I should’ve done (from a friend):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Placed a sheet of foil underneath</li>
  <li>Cleaned the tray</li>
  <li>Removed the thermal paste from the board.</li>
  <li>Placed one more foil ball underneath a corner.</li>
</ul>

<p>But I didn’t, and thankfully, it turned out ok.</p>

<p>Before baking:</p>

<p>After:</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/Now just waiting to cool.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you can see, there is a bit of board flex. Whoops. Make sure you put a piece of foil under that corner.</p>

<p>Success:</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone!</p>

                 <p>A while back, about a month, I was presented with the opportunity to swap computers. A PowerBook Ti for a Clamshell. At the time, I had two Ti books, one 500MHz, original, fully loaded with AirPort card. A really nice machine, but at the same time, I really wanted an iBook G3 Clamshell. I had never seen one. I had never touched one. For those who do not know what an iBook ‘Clamshell’ is, here is a pic:</p>

<p><img src="https://appleclamshell.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/steve-jobs-apple-ibook-picture.jpg" alt="Stevie loves clammy" /></p>

<p>It is a rather massive laptop, and to PC users, it a giant toilet seat, but few can appreciate the gentle curves, resembling a seashell, or a clamshell.</p>

<p>Here it is, again, showcasing how MASSIVE it is:</p>

<p><img src="https://d2npbuaakacvlz.cloudfront.net/images/uploaded/large-present/welcome-to-the-family/DSC_0612.JPG" alt="15&quot; MBP vs Clamshell" /></p>

<p>Although it is a very large device, the OS is trapped inside a tiny screen. 800x600, ouch! Luckily, there is a modification that allows you to put a much larger screen inside the later model.
Back to the story. I ended up shipping the TiBook, and two days later receiving an Indigo Clamshell, sans battery. After a ‘quick’ hard drive replacement (5GB 4200 RPM, V.S. 60GB 7200 RPM), I installed OS X 10.4.11 and OS 9.2.1. and simply enjoyed it. I was limited by the lack of battery, but it was still a hoot!</p>

<p><em>Fast forward to yesterday</em></p>

<p>I was at work, and a package came in for me. I figured it would be a PoE switch for resetting Cisco phones. Nope! A bright orange Clamshell met my eyes. A mutual friend, inside of the company, spotted this at his location, and shipped it to me. What a surprise! Said co-worker was throughly thanked!
Within a month, I got two clamshells, one of the most desired vintage laptop, to date.</p>

                 <p>Today, I received a copy of the later 10.7 Beta, build 11A390. The date on the install CD is 2011, and for those who do not know, Lion was officially released July of 2011.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/Slack for iOS Upload.jpg" alt="Lion 2011 Beta" /></p>

<p>Quickly, I pulled out my trusty 2009 Black MacBook to do a test install. I did, however, try anyway on my MacBookPro1,1, just in case we had a 32-bit EFI bootloader. On initial glance at the DVD, which init of itself is quite amazing, since Lion was never sold on one. Only digital download or on a $20 USB stick (which I own too), there wasn’t any welcome documentation, nor was there the Lion install icon, but something more generic instead.</p>

<p>Just X</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

<p>Anyway, onto installing. I booted into the installer, and was greeted by the modern ‘OS X Utilities’, but had stylings stuck between Snow Leopard and Lion.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1819.JPG" alt="Mac OS X Utilities" /></p>

<p>Another weird thing inside of Disk Utility:</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1821.JPG" alt="UISegmentedControl" /></p>

<p>The segment control was nothing like I’ve seen before.</p>

<p>Anyway, post installation time, time for setup. We did get the lovely welcome video from Leopard, which was refreshing, even after hearing it a billion times.</p>

<p>First, the background wasn’t the sterile gray, we had a nice picture of Mt. Fiji:</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1825.JPG" alt="Mt Feejee" /></p>

<p>I personally think it looks far better, I never noticed how nice that pic looks.</p>

<p>Then, it gave me the option to add encrypt my disk, something not implemented until 10.10. I wonder why they didn’t do it when they had the option to.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1827.JPG" alt="Yosemite? Anyone?" /></p>

<p>I opted not to, just in case some odd bug arose, which prevented me from exploring the rest of the operating system.</p>

<p>Here we are at the desktop of 10.7, beta! Take note of the Launchpad icon.
Quite ugly, glad it was changed.</p>

<p>I went to About My Mac-&gt;More Info, just to see the build number, and was greeted by this:</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/Screen Shot 2016-05-16 at 10.01.55 PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some weird mutant view. I do kinda like it though, not the icons.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/Screen Shot 2016-05-16 at 10.02.02 PM.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The battery view is very nice, I could definitely see this making a come back, maybe with an overall battery health meter, a la CoconutBattery?</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/Screen Shot 2016-05-16 at 10.05.52 PM.png" alt="TM" /></p>

<p>Time Machine also had a few surprises, it had the option to store hourly snapshots locally, and daily backups on a Time Machine drive/server. Once again, if properly working, I’d love that to make a reappearance.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/Screen Shot 2016-05-16 at 10.07.23 PM.png" alt="Software updates" /></p>

<p>Oh, I should probably update that :)</p>

<p>That about wraps it up.</p>

            <div class="post-text">
                 <p>Today I received a ShuttleX PC. It is a small form-factor machine, with a custom board. Smaller than an ITX board, the custom motherboard inside of the ShuttleX features a PCI and AGP slot, 2xDDR2 RAM slots, and a Pentium 4 CPU. Although, not too powerful, it is still a very cool machine. However, it has been a long-time dream of mine to have a PC that is easily carried around. This one fits in my backpack.</p>

<p>Anyway, onto the modification. A penalty of doing an ITX mod is that you lose a PCI-E slot. Not on your board, but on the outside of the case. The custom motherboard is designed in such a way, that there are two slots, but it is one slot too close. Instead of brutally hacking at the case until something happens, I decided to make the GPU of choice a ‘low profile’ card.</p>

<p>Speaking of the GPU choice, I have a spare GTX650 I am going to use.</p>

<p>It is an EVGA ‘SuperClocked’ card, and it is pretty snappy for most games. CS-GO doesn’t need much, you guys.</p>

<h2 id="disassembly">Disassembly:</h2>

<p>First, taking the card apart:</p>

<p>There are four screws ‘under’ the fan blades, and one ‘holding’ the PCIE cover on. Remove those and the case.</p>

<p>Now, finding a card that has a similar port layout.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1787.JPG" alt="Comparing ports" /></p>

<p>I found something that worked, well with enough work. I do not know what/where it came from, but it was one of those OEM Dell cards with the multi-monitor port.</p>

<p>I removed the bracket from the GTX 650 as well, so I could trace the ports and cut to spec, not hard in theory.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1788.JPG" alt="The bracket" /></p>

<h2 id="modding">Modding:</h2>

<p>Here is the card in its ‘pre surgical’ state. The black marks are simply permanent marker marks.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1789.JPG" alt="All marked up" /></p>

<p>And its ‘post surgical state’. She isn’t pretty yet. I just used a drill bit to remove the majority of the metal, and I’ll file/cut finer with a Dremel.</p>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1790.JPG" alt="After some drilling and, well, not filling" /></p>

<p>For some reason, I didn’t get a between photo, but I just used a Dremel cutting wheel and polishing wedge to get the job done. The port was shaped decently so.</p>

<p>Here is a photo of me comparing with the OEM card inside of the ShuttleX. The port layout works fine!</p>

<h2 id="final-product">Final Product:</h2>

<p><img src="http://images.128keaton.com/2016/05/IMG_1791.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>I do not know temperatures yet, or if I’ll need a fan. Time will tell.</p>
