                 <p>This was really interesting to wake up and see.</p>

<p>Seems like Apple has finally realized something. Their Pro market is a bit unhappy. It is very interesting that they “conceited defeat” by admitting that the industry went a different way than they were expecting.
The biggest reason they took such a jump to a smaller, and enclosed enclosure was because of a hopeful future in parallel GPU technology. However, it never really happened that way. For a video editing professional, a single upgraded (and probably flashed) GPU is enough, provided they have a Mac Pro with upgradable internals.</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p>When it comes to timeline, it isn’t quite clear <em>when</em> Apple will release, other than its planned for next year, alongside a new display. I will say this, even if both are a flop, I am still extremely excited for the coming years at Apple. They have realized their mistake, but it wasn’t a mistake they made knowingly until recently. Apple has recognized their own issue and is <strong>currently fixing it</strong>. Apple <strong>admitted fault</strong> and <strong>conceited defeat</strong> themselves. Impressive. Especially after seeing the very strange array of <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/02/02/reports-of-lg-ultrafine-5k-display-problems-persist-may-relate-to-thunderbolt-cables">issues</a> with the recent LG 5K displays. Apple has learned, from that hilariously bad decision, if they want it done right, Apple should do it themselves. Now, after years of sliding, I am really excited for Apple again. I’m excited since I own the last upgradable Mac Pro, I own the 2nd to last upgradable MacBook Pro (2011), and I’m ready for something that isn’t on the market yet.</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p>As an iOS and macOS developer, I use Apple’s tools, because you really can’t use anything else properly. I’d like to say Xcode is this smart, sleek piece of IDE that works incredibly well. That would be a lie. I’d like to say it uses a proportionate amount of RAM, doesn’t bug out sometimes causing lack-luster performance, and mysterious issues only solved with a relaunch. I’d really love to. But Xcode isn’t that piece of software. It is fat, bloated, and very frustrating sometimes. I’m using Apple software on an Apple machine running Apple’s operating system and I’m having a hard time. Without my machines being upgradable, I doubt I’d be able to run Xcode and develop for iOS/macOS.</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<div class="notice--quote">

<p>We think it’s really important to create something great for our pro customers who want a Mac Pro modular system…</p>

</div>
<p>Though we don’t know much about the form-factor, it is guaranteed to be modular in some way, shape, or form. If you’ve worked on an HP server recently, you’ll know that their CPU, GPU, and RAM modularity is fantastic. My personal favorite is the HP ProLiant DL580 G6. Front-facing removable RAM and CPU tray. No screws hold the heatsink, its all levers. The RAM slides out in modular boxes ready to be filled and slotted back. The PCIe lanes are basic, but it works very well. No screws either, just another big blue lever. Now, I don’t want a Mac Pro as <em>large</em> as a DL580, but I don’t want it small either.</p>

<p>My logic is this, larger Mac Pro, more upgradability, better airflow.</p>

<p>And it needs to be beautiful.</p>

<p>I’m not worried about that last bit, as I know, Apple being Apple, some piece will have a more form over function approach to it, hopefully something trivial.</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p>Another nice tid-bit is the speed bump the existing Mac Pros are getting, and now we have hope for a new Mac Mini, which brings me more hope. The Mac Mini was the cheap Mac. I’d recommend it to anyone who needed a small server for their macOS powered camp, or for people uncertain about the Apple eco-system and in dire need of replacing their Windows box. This makes me so excited and looking forward to whatever shoots out of Apple next. When I was last in the Apple store, I was waiting for a 2012 retina repair to be finished. While I did, a lady, who introduced herself as a teacher, walked in, grabbed the nearest blue-shirt and pointed to the new MacBook Pro (with Touch Bar), and said: “I want that one, in gray”. The blue-shirt turned around and walked to the back. The lady sat there excitedly rocking back and forth on her heels. I asked her,</p>

<p>“Is this your first MacBook?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Now that the new ones are out, I can finally buy one.”</p>

<p>The blue-shirt returned with a white box, and a bag.</p>

<p>“Is this all we can help you with today?”</p>

<p>I think Apple will see a very decent uptick of purchases from non-Pro users too, just people who want the most future proof, or the most powerful. More or less like the gentleman who buys the most powerful Tahoe–not because it has good “highway passing power”, but because its the <em>fastest</em>.</p>

<div class="break"></div>

<p>I’m super excited for the Mac line, no matter what comes next, I think it’ll be great.</p>

<div class="notice--quote">

<p>My takeaway is that the Mac’s future is bright.</p>

                 <p>First let me preface this ‘review’ by stating that I actually didn’t use iOS 6 for the duration of this test because I <em>couldn’t</em>. Not because it was unusable in the standard sense, when I purchased the phone, I failed to realize that it was a GSM/AT&amp;T only phone, missing the bands for CDMA carriers, like mine, Verizon. Still I used it as much as I could, barring things that required cellular service, i.e. actual texts and phone calls.</p>

<p>Now, lets delve into the review.</p>

<h2 id="the-review-unit">The Review Unit</h2>

<p><strong>iPhone 5, 16GB, black</strong></p>

<p><em>back in black!! not that slate crap</em></p>

<p><img src="/_images/iphone_ios_6/IMG_1068.JPG#stylized" alt="" /></p>

<p>The iPhone 7 ‘matte black’ before it was cool! Ladies and gentleman, feast your eyes on what $98 netted me on the Ebay. Before I continue, I wanna say that this is my THIRD phone to have purchased. The first one, even though it was told that I’d receive the photos EXACTLY how the pictures depicted it, and was even assured that it would not be updated, it was, to fateful iOS 10. The second unit was pretty good, it was kinda junky, but it <em>worked</em>, until it didn’t 😞. Long story short, both were refunded, and I finally said ‘enough’, and bought one on iOS 6.1.4. Some might not like the pateña look on their iPhone, but the slate just <em>damages</em> so well.</p>

<p>John Gruber, on the black iPhone 5:</p>

<div class="notice--quote">
The “slate” anodization did show wear and tear as the year went by, but I liked the effect. Like a good pair of jeans or a leather watch strap.
</div>

<img src="/_images/iphone_ios_6/IMG_1071.JPG#stylized-small" alt="" /></p>

<p>😍😍😍😍</p>

<p>I just love it. Now, I do like the feel of the phone, but I really enjoy the size and shape of the 7+ better. Plus, the camera is stellar (though the 5’s is nothing to hock a loogie at). So  a SE isn’t for me, plus the 5 has something that the SE never will: iOS 6.</p>

<h3 id="oh-these-just-images-from-my-5">oh, these? just images from my 5:</h3>

<img src="/_images/iphone_ios_6/IMG_0015.JPG#stylized-small" alt="" /></p>

<p>Not bad, eh?</p>

<h2 id="ios-6-applications">iOS 6: Applications</h2>

<p>Now, I am a simple man, I don’t do much outside of basic stuff.</p>

<p>Here is a table of applications that I use enough to consider ‘essential’ (outside of system apps):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Application</th>
      <th>Status</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Snapchat</td>
      <td>😵</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mactracker</td>
      <td>😁</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hangouts</td>
      <td>😁</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>BofA</td>
      <td>😵</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ebay</td>
      <td>😁</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Netflix</td>
      <td>😁</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>See, I’m simple! Even me losing Snapchat is no biggie! No nudes for me!</p>

<p>Hangouts works fine, I can talk with my co-workers who don’t wanna use Slack. Another good app with iOS 6 support is Telegram. Netflix is a web wrapper (which explains ALOT, y’all, nativity is fine!). Even a couple of games worked without having to downgrade.</p>

<h2 id="ios-6-speed">iOS 6: Speed.</h2>

<p>Now, it may be placebo (placky-bow), but holy lingonberries, iOS 6 is <em>fast</em>.</p>

<p>The animations in iOS 10 surely slow it down, but the content just feels snappier, plus having a UI designed to mimic <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/995953-Bus-Schedule-App">real-world</a> objects is just <strong>tasty</strong>.</p>

<p>Boot-up time is slower than my 7+, and Cydia doesn’t have multitasking support in iOS 6, but typing never lags, the multitasking switcher is instant, plus I’ve yet to see a frame drop. It is also interesting to think that this has 1GB of RAM, while the flagship Apple iDevice (the non <code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code> variant, at least) has 2GB. Hmm. Real-world ‘speed’ is also pretty decent, clocking in at 721 on the ‘Single Core’ Geekbench, as you can see <a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench3/8221245">here</a>, coming very close to a late 2008 MacBook Pro 15” and a Google Indexing Server (well, just look, bleh), and beating an IBM Thinkpad X51, which is quite cool, considering the power in your pocket beats the power on your lap and in your office from seven years ago.</p>

<p>Part of me thinks that mobile OS and web designers have gotten lazy, the amount of RAM and processing power has increased so that we can easily <em>be</em> lazy, but thats just personal opinion.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up.</h2>

<p>Overall, I think using an iPhone 5 in iOS 6 is still an easy task, and it can be enjoyable if you really think that iOS 6 is beautiful like I do. The hardware is solid, a perfect mix of utilitarianism and industrial simplicity. Especially the black, really, its gorgeous. It is a cool throwback, though, a time when Steve Jobs had some say in the design, no doubt on his deathbed he was hem-ing and haw-ing over little details. This is pre-Yosemite, or pre-San Francisco, a world of Helvetica-Neue washes over the entirety. Bringing this phone into this age with iOS 10 is near-criminal, kinda like having the good ol’ farm dog pull the family carriage into town.</p>

<p>That is the iPhone 5 today, the kinda scruffy, yet extremely lovable dog.</p>

<p>If you use the dog for what it was designed for, like keeping it on iOS 6, it works! It just does!  iOS 6 is smooth, fluid, and has features to sate the average, and daresay, power user!</p>

<p>I just think it was a waste of design, moving to iOS 7 so abruptly.</p>

<p>I’m a bit disappointed. Mozilla makes a couple of great things (Firefox, Rust, MDN, …). But in contrast to their products, I have a quite bad impression of their Foundation and/or Corporation. I don’t know if it is warranted or not, but I have the impression that they mostly exist to burn through the millions they get from Google for setting them as default search engine.</p>

</div>

<p>This is exactly why they are trying to rebrand themselves, to move away from preconceived notions, similar to yours. Not that I’m advocating for the Mozilla Foundation, but that is exactly right</p>

<div class="notice--quote">


<p>This new branding doesn’t help at all with my perception of Mozilla. If anything, it emphasizes the perception that Mozilla is a bloated entity disconnected from the products I care about. That they put a nerdy “://” in there to appeal technical means to me that they are even aware of this.</p>

</div>

<p>And that is where they steered themselves wrong. Most college-age students, people that they seem to be gunning for with the horror-show of meme images, use Chrome, and Chromebooks, or Safari. I personally use Firefox, but they just keep falling short of my expectations. Now, I love this next bit</p>

<div class="notice--quote">


<p>What I would have done is to go back to the early 2000s unapologetically retro dinosaur. This was from a time when Mozilla was the underdog, when it was the Free alternative, when it was getting better and better, and when Firefox was invented.</p>

</div>

<p>The only problem with that is no one they want to use their browser will understand this, plus Firefox hasn’t gotten better for a long time.</p>

                 <p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/coolbooter">Coolbooter</a>, we can now downgrade to any capable versions that our 32-bit iDevices can run (iPad 2-4, iPhone 4-5c), but what if you have an iPhone that is iCloud locked?</p>

<div class="notice--info">
  
<h4 id="note">Note:</h4>
<p>Now, this isn’t a ‘work-around’ per-se, just a way to get to the homescreen. Activation and whatnot is NOT guaranteed with this method, and you need to have the phone already jailbroken and you need to have homescreen access, i.e. no passcode. Coolbooter is in beta. BETA! It might break your phone.</p>

<p>Also, this has only been tested on iOS 6. ymmv.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="step-1---installing-coolbooter">Step 1 - Installing Coolbooter.</h2>

<p>If you haven’t already, add the Coolbooter repo to Cydia (https://coolbooter.com) and install the Coolbooter Beta package. It’s pretty straightforward.</p>

<h2 id="step-2---d-d-d-downgrading">Step 2 - D-d-d-downgrading.</h2>

<p>Select the version you want to install (once again, only tested on iOS 6) and install. Coolbooter takes a decent amount of time to download, parition and move everything into place. Then tap ‘Boot’ and boot into iOS 6. Run through the setup to verify that you can’t log in to the locked account.</p>

<h2 id="step-3---installing-openssh-because-if-you-didnt-you-are-doing-it-wrong">Step 3 - Installing OpenSSH (because if you didn’t you are doing it wrong).</h2>

<p>Boot back into your main OS (just shut down and turn back on) and install ‘OpenSSH’ in Cydia. If you don’t know how to SSH into your own device, then stop right here and contemplate your life choices and return at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="note-change-your-openssh-root-password-using-passwd">Note: change your OpenSSH root password using <code class="highlighter-rouge">passwd</code></h3>

<div id="stahp">

## Step 3a - Contemplating your life choices.

Are you one of those people who post on /r/jailbreak like its your personal Google? Stop it. You are bad. Do you reply to @qwertyuiop's tweets asking 'eta wen' or other begging crap? Stop it. You are bad.

</div>

<h2 id="step-4---mounting-the-secondary-partition">Step 4 - Mounting the secondary partition.</h2>

<p>First, list your devices or partitions in your SSH session with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ls /dev/</code>, I’d bet some serious money your iOS 6 partition is something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/disk0s1s3</code>. If a mounting point (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">/mnt</code>) doesn’t exist, make one with <code class="highlighter-rouge">mkdir /mnt</code>. Finally, run:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"> mount -t hfs /dev/disk0s1s3 /mnt</code></pre></figure>

<p>Substitute <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dev/disk0s1s3</code> for your device.</p>

<h2 id="step-5---removing-the-setup-app">Step 5 - Removing the setup app.</h2>

<p>We’re almost DUNNN. Just run:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd</span> /mnt/Applications <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> rm -rf Setup.app</code></pre></figure>

<p>Boot back into your secondary OS and you should see a lockscreen instead of a setup screen</p>

<p>If you broke some stuff, sorry, your fault</p>

                 <p>The Kindle Keyboard 3, or Kindle 3, is absolutely one of my favorite Kindles.</p>

<p>It features a full keyboard (SYM key gives you punctation), sports a Linux kernel (you can actually run Debian on them), easily jailbreakable, weighted properly, and has physical page buttons.</p>

<p>They are one of the last easily serviceable e-readers from Amazon.</p>

<p>They are very cheap on eBay and are still able to sync with your Amazon account easily, some of the special models even have 3G. Having 3G is especially handy since you now have a remote terminal with Debian. SSH into any server on the fly! The one fatal flaw the device has is the screen. While it isn’t too expensive to replace ($25), you have to dissassemble the entire device. Thankfully, there are only two screws and one ribbon cable, plus prying off the snap-on plastic back. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Kindle+3+Screen+Replacement/29843">iFixit</a> has you covered. My only tips are, just undo the orange ribbon cable (see photo).
<img src="https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/YJW3xKyWIxFHOucJ.medium" alt=":D" /></p>

<p>And on step 7/8 take out the motherboard and plate as a whole.</p>

<p>I have two sitting waiting for new screens. I plan to give them as Christmas gifts since I believe they are much more utilitarian than the newer ones. In the future, I plan to make a reading light attachment, but thats all in the future.</p>

<p>Now, I bought two new screens from an eBay seller (unnamed for privacy). After assembling, I noticed some very frustrating ghosting on the screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.sli.mg/RV9EDW.jpg" alt=":()" /><img src="https://i.sli.mg/bFM35I.jpg" alt=":()" /></p>

<p>From now on, I’ll buy my screens from PowerBookMedic, which has a great selection of Kindle parts. You could basically build one out of their inventory. I ended up buying two new faceplates and backs for $8.00. I will be going to the post office to ship the faulty screens back and hopefully buying a quality set of screens. I will update as soon as I get them installed.</p>
