<p class="intro"><span class="red">W</span>hy pretend to drive a Sport Utility Vehicle. Get serious. Drive the real thing: the 1993 Toyota 4Runner.
  Just point it in a direction and go. You're likely to end up in places even the guidebook failed to mention.
  That's OK, because you've arrived there with the power and presence of a true Sport Utility Vehicleâ€”and you've done it with comfort and control.
  This tough, versatile machine is born of the same 4WD heritage as the famous Toyota 4x4 Pickup and legendary Land Cruiser.
With 4Runner, the trail begins and ends with satisfaction. Satisfaction derived from knowing that this is just the vehicle to broaden your horizons.
